20180826-023807_40_live	Did you Know that Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think I've heard of them, but aren't they religiously affiliated?	I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.	Yes they are affiliated with religion but all proceeds are put towards saving the children they do profit are use any funds for personal gain or spread of religion.	How transparent are they about uses of their funds?	Are they well rated by the watchdog groups that keep an eye on non-profits?	Save the Children is.	Mention the organization's credentials and international impact	It's great to hear there are people out there doing such important work.	Have you ever donated to them?	Yes I have , how much do you spend on unnecessary stuff like a bag of snack or candy.	You Know small donations can help a lot of children and their families	Really?	I suppose even with the economy being as hard as it is, exchange rates are still good enough to make a real impact.	Yes any donations made to helpless children make a real impact on their life.	Not many kids get a real shot and they all deserve one If I had a chance to change a childs life foe the better and didn't I would not be able to live with myself.	That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?	I did't I just gave what I thougt cas right and took the blow .	I thought about how these kids do without so much and realized I could do without once in order to help someone in need	So how did you decide what was right for you?	I gave what was given to me .	Over the next few chats I'm going to tell you the story of Bruce a child that like alot of these chidren need help but threw Save The Chidren found it.	At the end Of our next few chats I'm going to ask you to  donate what you earn from this survey .	I want you to think about what it means to save a child thats in trouble and how by saving that child you find new hope in your own life.	I'm certainly willing to listen.	Tell me about Bruce.	Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house.	The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story .	He came to meet Bruce .	That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that.	I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though.	How did the visit go?	Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today.	The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce .	That's awesome!	He even made it through college.	I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.	If only all kids were so lucky.	But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most	Now I would Like to ask you to donate what you about to receive and and give to other in need.	Yiur will go to help other just like that right now are looking or in room by themselves hoping for a miracle .	Will you be that miracle and help a child like Bruce today?	I will.	Be the change you want to see in the world, right?	Yes you will .	So how much of your earnings will you give, for a child that needs to be saved today?.	5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children
20180723-055038_776_live	Hey, hows it going	can't complain, youreslf?	Im ok, just doing some work lol.	So, do you want to donate any of your income to a Save the Children charity?	yeah sure, why not	Awesome, how much do you want to donate?	is there an upper limit?	I dont think there is	how much are you thinking of donating	Oh I see, it says here that it will be deducted from your task payment.	Wonder how that will work.	I don't believe they can actually do that haha	Yeah, same.	I assume it will be deducted from any bonuses they decide to give.	hows $0.50 sound?	Sounds good to me lol	ok, good deal, $0.50 it is.	Alright, awesome, guess that's it then?	I think so, it said we need to get to 10 turns of the conversation each, this is my 8th lol	Ah, yeah I just counted mine as well. Well, unless, you want to donate more, I think we're pretty much done here.	I'm fine with staying at $0.50 as long as you are	Im good with that as well.	Thanks for your quick responses btw.	A lot of the time, these things don't go very smoothly since you have to wait a while for a response.	ugh yeah, i've seen that, you sit there waiting forever for someone to type two words haha	Yeah, true, it's terrible.	Thanks for your help and have a good Turk day :D	you too!!!!! :D
20180825-070515_947_live	what you think about save the children donation ?	I think it is a genuine organization who uses it's fundraising donations in the right way.	you dont think anything bad is happening with this donation?	No I think they use most of their donations to actually help children.	Do you believe they don't?	i really dont have a real opinion , but the world is dirty and everybody cheat.	I think there are a lot of safeguards in organizations like this one that is set up to prevent such a thing.	so you think to trust this organisation and help the children with donating in the future?	Yes, for sure.	I think they are a trustworthy organization.	did they ever did a big mistake that was all over the news?	I am not aware of that.	In fact, I believe they were a top-rated children's charity the last couple years.	did they collect a lot of money for the children's?	I am pretty sure they do.	Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.	i always thought that the money goes for other things and not the children , but i am spectral about this.	Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.	things must be always clear to the public eyes .	True, especially if you take part in donating.	However, I usually just give where I feel I need to and if people use it the wrong way, I believe they will get what's coming to them.	if what you say i true i agree with you completely.	Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.	blind trust it is.	But i know for sure that they help a lot of children, the question is can they do more with that amount of money?	Well I'm sure there is always more that can be done.	I just feel that if they help a few children get a better childhood then it is worth it.	Children are our future.
20180723-091419_371_live	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I haven't!	It's basically what it sounds like	What kind of situations do they work with?	The organization helps children around the world with life, protecting them, coming to their aid when a crisis arises, helping them when necessary.	That sounds like an awesome organization!	Do you know how someone can get involved?	They have a website.	You can also make a .50 cent donation through me from your compensation of this hit.	The donation will go towards food and/or aiding them with their health.	That's simple enough.	I like the sound of that!	Have you ever personally worked with them?	I have made donations in the past, yes.	It made me feel good to know that I could provide some type of help especially because I have children of my own.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Gotcha!	I also have a child, so I understand where you're coming from.	I have a soft spot for children in general.	Same!	Especially less fortunate children.	Absolutely!	I always think about how I would want to know my child is cared for if I'm not around.	It's definitely a motivator!	I agree.	This is one of my favorite organizations to donate to and they're well known and have done so much for children all over.	That's good to know that they're reputable.	Sometimes I'm cautious of donating, just because I want to know that they're making the difference that they saw they are.	At least here we know the researchers are making the donations through this hit.	It is nice to know that!	So you'd like to donate?!	Yes, I would :)	Awesome!	Thank you so much :)	Oh yeah, absolutely!!
20180827-053243_818_live	Hello!	hi	Have you heard of the charity, Save the Children?	no I have not...what is it about?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.	URL	ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries	Yes, it is good.	But they are really under funded.	Would you be willing to donate to the charity now?	I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world	I understand that.	Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.	Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..	It is the right thing to do.	That helps people directly in your community.	A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community.	There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your small donation can address such problems.	Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?	I'm in the United States.	I live in Indiana.	cool i never been how is it??	I live in new york	The weather is totally hit or miss.	Right now it's in the 90's and sooo humid!	Indiana is so flat and really all looks the same.	We have a lot of farmers here.	So it's true, there is a lot of corn in Indiana. lol	How much would you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	at the moment i would have to say 0 because i don't know to much about the charity...sorry	Bummer, even 5 cents of your pay out helps!!!	But I do get it.	Please consider giving even 5 cents.	How is NY?	I would love to travel there one day.	I bet everything is so over priced.	yes everything is high priced	I figured!	IN is really conservative.	Again, look over the charity information and consider a small donation	I will look at the website after this survey and read more about it..I promise	I hope so.	Like I said even a small donation of 5 cents is tremendous to them.	Thank you and have a wonderful day
20180826-070323_186_live	Hi!	How are you doing today?	Good, thanks!	How are you?	I am doing well thank you.	Do you ever donate to charity?	In the past few years I rarely have.	I know, it can be hard to donate. especially in today's society, but a tiny amount, even less than a dollar, can go a long way	That seems so hard to believe, but I guess lots of pennies still add up!	Exactly, I feel the same way sometimes, but think if everyone in the US gave a nickel, that's over 16 million dollars	Wow, that definitely puts it in perspective!	There are so many charities too, but I believe that children are the future, and we need to do what we can to help them have fulfilling lives	I agree with you!	Have you ever volunteered?	It's another way to help without having to spend any money	I have!	I used to volunteer often, but I have so little time it feels like now!	Time and money these days can be scarce!	But think about the little things you buy, and maybe one week, instead of buying that bad of chips or cup of coffee, donate it to the children	You're right!	It doesn't take much sacrifice to think of small ways to help!	And think of all the kiddies you will be helping!	Haha that's true!	do you think you will donate today?	I think so!	How much would you like to donate?	I'm not sure!	What is the range of options?
20180825-081502_364_live	Hi!	How are you today?	Hey there how's it going?	Pretty good I am sitting on my desk enjoying this beautiful weather.	How about you?	Today is beautiful!!	I think it's time to take a walk a little later!	That sounds like a great idea!	How do you feel about children's charities?	It depends on the charity!	There are some good ones and some that have turned out to be scams.	I agree with that 100%.	My charity of choice is Save The Children.	Have you heard of that charity before?	I have not!	Do you work for them or have you donated with them before?	I donate to them regularly.	They do so much good for under privileged kids.	What kind of stuff do they do to help the children?	They feed so many starving children.	They do a lot for kids, you should visit their website. Www. URL	Oh that's great!!	I think children deserve all the help they can get.	Is this an American charity?	Yes it is!	You know you can donate a portion of your payment from this directly to Save The Children.	Would you be interested in that?	I would possibly be interested in that.	How can I be sure that it will go where it's supposed to?	The researchers have everything lined up with Save The Children.	I am going to donate my payment.	What are the typical donations to the charity like?	You can choose to donate any amount that you wish.	Every little bit helps!	Unfortunately I am having some money troubles right now so it's a little hard for me to promise any significant amount of money at the moment.	Something as small as .05 could help.	I understand financial strain I my self have been struggling.	It is much easier for me to donate from this platform that to pay out of pocket, and it sounds like it would be easier for you as well.	I would be interested in donating five cents.	I could definitely do that.	Sorry I can't donate more :(	05 is perfect!	Thank you so much for your donation!
20180825-070857_925_live	Hello.	I hope you are well today.	I am wondering if you regularly give to charity?	Yes I do.	I find it very fulfilling to give back	I agree with you on that.	I am just now watching the news about the hurricane in Hawaii and seeing the damage already done.	It is very scary to think about.	Not only are they ravaged by the volcano, now a hurricane.	I know.	I actually have family living there.	The rains over the past two days have been awful.	I am curious what we can do to help.	I have been looking into ways to help.	I see that an organization called Save the Children is already mobilizing to help.	Do you know anything about how they are helping the children?	They have an emergency response team ready to go.	They are preparing child-specific and focused supplies in case they are needed.	They are in touch with officials in Hawaii.	That's really awesome, are they more in need of supplies or monetary donations?	Definitely more in need of monetary donations.	They are asking people to donate to their emergency fund.	Do they have a donation tier level?	I want to help out as much as I can.	If you are willing, you can actually donate from your payment from this hit!	Really?	What forms of payments are accepted?/	They can deduct directly from your payment from this task.	That is nice.	But I would like to give more than a measly $2.	Is there another way to donate?/	How nice of you.	Yes, I can give you that information, but would you like to start with donating part or all of your payment for this hit?	I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.	This goes into a different fund.	But I would like to be able $150 to this charity.	Wow!	That is very generous.	I am still thinking, though, that the small donations made from these hits are so easy to donate and can really add up if we all pitch in together!	You can even just give a very small portion of your compensation from this hit.	I can donate the .30 base payment but I am still very curious on donating outside the HIT.	Thank you so much.	Your .30 will be greatly appreciated by Save the Children.	Go to  URL to learn more an donate!	Thank you for your generosity!
20180826-220528_999_live	How do you feel about childrens charities?	Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?	I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	I do have a soft spot for children.	As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.	I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can.	I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses.	I think the work that charities can do is so important.	Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better.	Have you heard about the charity Save the children?	yes I have.	In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children.	You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does.	I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?	I believe it could be true.	However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	I agree.	It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity.	It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact.	Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?	Personally, transparency is especially vital.	When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	I agree.	I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund.	Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so?	Honestly, it should be a choice.	I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it.	I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation.	I think most people would help just to help.	Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?	I think so.	Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	If they don't, it's completely understandable.	In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	However, every cent counts.	It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	It's all about giving.	I think that would be a more effective message sometimes.	Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help.	Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have?	Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?	Those are very good questions.	It depends on the way they see it.	Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it.	At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity.	Do you think most people say yes to this?	Or they would usually say maybe next time	Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	I have seen a lot of people do the same.	I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children.	The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.	Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?	Yes I would.	I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	That is amazing.	To be honest, I have really enjoyed your opinions on charitable giving like this. How much of your task payment do you want to donate now?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all	I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.
20180827-043632_426_live	Hello, how are you?	Am Great, How about you?	I'm good.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	Yes I have Heard	I really like them, I've volunteered for them before.

I like that they're committed to helping children in need.	They're very transparent in their work and do great things to help children in underprivileged countries.	Yes, I also like what they do.	They are a great organization.	I'm planning on donating most of my earnings today.	Would you like to donate as well?	I would like to dotate $0.20.	Would that help?	Yes it would.	Any little bit helps.	Thank you for your donation!

I want to help the children irrespective of their color and creed.	I think it is the important aspect of donating money to charity	Ya if everyone is ready to donate something what i someone having is we can able to control the poor and we have some pride	I accept your view and it is necessary that everyone should contribute at least to some extent to children's charity	Yes in developing countries lack of educations for childrens in war zone and even if you taken in syria the millions of peoples meet their daily days by violance but we have a great days so we make that happier and healthier	I think our must move cautiously to deal with this country.	But I think UNO and UNICEF can contribute a lot if they desired to do so.	Yes UNO and UNICEF is included this things more.	We do what we can and help something we can for the poor childrens	I agree with you.	But i think more rich people should come forward to establish such children's charity	of course.

20180826-184037_209_live	Hello, how are you?	Fine, thank you.	How do you feel about donating to a children's charity?	I always they to donate when ever I am able.	Especially childrens charities, children are so innocent and deserve the best chance at life.	But do you really trust the charities that you give to?	Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?	YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to.	For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer.	I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives.	So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.	I agree, the local charities are good.	I don't trust the bigger charities.	I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.	Sadly that is true some times.	How do you feel about donating to childrens charities?	I think it is better to help children yourself.	That way, you know what the money is being used for.	Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs.	We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to.	How much do you usually donate every year>	I try to donate at least 250 every year.	That is good.	Do you have any kids?	Yes, I have two and I have a lot of nephews and nieces,	1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me.	Do you have children?	I do not have any children yet.	do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?	Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you.	It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child.	Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.	That is a great way to think about it.	I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	What do you think?	Yes I am fine with that	It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.	If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.	Yes that is what I believe to, We wouldn't even notice 10 cents we spend so much on coffee little things the .10 cents is nothing.	Agreed.	We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.

Save the Children is an organization that helps children in developing countries, by promoting children's rights and providing relief.	I think they help pay for their education and other necessities.	Do you have any experince dealing with them at all?	I personally haven't ever dealt with them, I have just seen a lot of commercials and heard about the organization for many years.	I have heard that they work hard to give kids a better life.	Yes, I have heard that about them too.	I have thought about donating before, but never got around to it.	Would you be willing to donate some, or all, of your payment from this task to Save the Children?	Yes, I think I would be will to donate to the cause.	I think I would be willing to as well.	It appears that there is an option to donate some of your earnings, and the research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children :)	Oh that is really a great idea.	I think I would be able to donate some of my earnings.	Would $1 help at all?	That sounds great!	I'm guessing you would input your donation amount at the end of the task.	I would be glad to.	How much are you giving?	I'm going to give $1 as well :)	Well that is really great.	It sounds like a great charity.	I think they might even help in Hawaii with the recent floods, don't you think?	I bet the kids there are in need.	Yeah, I think they are doing some really important work!	I'm not sure exactly how the donations they get are distributed and if it only goes to developing countries, or also to disaster relief.	Yes, I'm not sure either, but it just kills me to know there are ids suffering.	How do you feel?	I feel the same.	It makes me so sad to know that some children are having a hard time even finding clean water to drink.	I think it's important for those of us in a first world country to help, but it's also so easy to overlook these things.	I know I have.	Yes, sometimes I feel a little guilty that I have it so easy.	I can not imagine food or clothing being a luxury.	Can you?	I can't imagine that either.	Those are things I've just always had, so sometimes I feel guilty that I haven't tried to do more to help others.	Yes, it really does cause feelings of guilt!	I completely agree!	It's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.	I completely agree!	It's not that we don't all have our own struggles, but it's just on a completely different level.

20180808-052501_689_live	Would you like to donate to a Charity called Save the Children?	Hi, it all depends on who you really are, if it's for a person very close to me if I'm willing	It would go to supporting children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	if I would agree with that, and if my organ donated what problems would my body have?	the operation has risks	I am not asking for an organ donation, but more of a financial one.	You can give any amount, even as little as $0.01 can help.	oh ok I'm sorry I have read wrong, if I would be willing to donate with pleasure is a good cause	How much would you like to donate?	I am willing to donate $ 10	Fantastic, you are a very generous person and this money will help the cause greatly	Not that, there are many needs in the world and this is a good cause	Yes, you are helping to ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	If sometimes I go down the street and there are people with posters I raise money for children and I always give them something because it is a good cause	Do you have children yourself?	Does this cause have a very personal meaning to you?	If I have two very beautiful children that are my life, maybe that's why I'm very attentive to things like this of this magnitude	What would you say to someone who does not have children, if you were trying to get them to help the cause?	to think about all the needs that a child in need at this moment is helping, and to think that this may be their child	Children really are the future and if humans have any hope of surviving in the long run, we need to raise our children to see the good in this world and help others	if it's what I think they have everything in their hands	Yes, Well I thank you again for your donation and I wish you a very happy rest of your day!	it is very happy day

I do have a web-site to to give you if to if you like to see if it was the same one you looked at.	yes, that would be great, I like to compare to see.

20180827-032231_430_live	hi how are you	good thanks.What about you?	what do you know about this organization	save th Children help kids in need around the world	The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They do an awesome labor	you donate for this children	I do sometimes whe I have extra money	very good for you	Yes children should have access to healthcare and basics needs	this is the most important thing for them and to make some happy ones	are you thinking about donate to the cause?	I give each end of the year $ 100 in the help of these children	It is very kind of you.Please spread the word on your family and friends	this is very important for my life and for my family to help not only our own people but also everybody who needs tons of help	Specially kids in need.There are some living in very bad conditions	this is true	Many of them lives on a war zone	there are needs for my help	yes.i am sure you can do more.there might be things you can cut from your budget
20180825-075647_663_live	Hello there!	can you donate	I can and am planning on donating.	It seems like a great cause.	Do you plan on donating too?	i might donate as well	I think it would be great if we both did	it would be great	I know if my child was in need I would hope people like us would make a donation - no matter how small.	this is really true	What motivates you to donate?	the children do	Yes it is truly up to us to help the millions of children in Syria who have grown up only knowing violence	i know its terrible right	Yes.	How much do you spend on small unnecessary items like coffee or snacks each day?	maybe like 15	Wow.	Imagine how helpful even a small fraction of that money would be to these kids	yep it will be great for those kids to help them with things they need	So how much do you think you'd like to donate?	The money will come right from your task payment.	maybe 5 dollars	Wow that is very generous of you	yeah i know	So you can confirm you'd like to donate $5?	yes i do
20180825-061105_792_live	Hello.	Hello!	I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.	Is that okay?	To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?	I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.	I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.	If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.	I feel really torn about the crisis.	I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	I actually didn't think of it like that.	I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.	This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead!	I don't know if that's really okay to do though.	I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	Sorry Im getting off topic.	No, that's relevant.	Really relevant.	It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.	I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.	If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.	The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.	You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.	With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.	SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.	I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!	I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.	I hope you have success  in your field.	I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.	I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.	I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.	They are the weak ones in my eyes.	I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do?	I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.	Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.	I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.	If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.	So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.	You want to match all our payment to Save the Children?	Would that be okay?	Or should we lock in your half payment?	I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	I would lock into half.	Sure let's do it.	I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids.	I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!	Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.	I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.	But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.	I always forget that kids turn into adults, i mean not that part, but the whole part where they are all apart of the community! :)	Thanks for talking me thru this today!	It is been enlightning!

20180723-073908_711_live	good morning!	Good morning.	have you ever heard of the charity save the children?	Yes.	I have but I can't say I am very familiar with what they do.	they assist with needy children around the world who are living in poverty.	That sounds right from what I know.	for example, they do work in syria where in the first 2 months of this year 1,000 children were killed or injured due to the violence there.	they help support children in those situations.	That sounds like a very worthy cause.	it is!	you can find out more at  URL if you want more specific examples.	but they work they do is very meaningful to children and their families (if they have them).

Instead of the typical charities that help children in a far away land, we here use state of the art location technology to help children in need right in your own community so you can see your money at work personally	What would my money do exactly	It would go to the three most important things that a child need.	Food, shelter, and education.	The majority of your donation would go towards education as that is often the most difficult to provide for the children	How would I know that the money is actually being used to help children and not just pocketed by the people that run the c harity	We are completely transparent with our records, when you donate you will be given an account so you can track where every bit of your money goes, from your account all the way to the community.	Okay, that sounds reasonable	We appreciate your willingness to donate to this local cause, how much of a gratuity will you be offering today?	I'll donate $10	Perfect, we will be sending over an email to setup your account info so you can track it and make any future donations if you desire.	Thank you and have a nice day	Good luck with your charity	Need a couple more chat turns	Yeah lol	And another :D	I have to make it more than 3 words	This should be the last one, adios o7	Yeah hopefully

Overall, it has gotten great reviews and many people who have donated feel gratified for doing their small part in potentially saving someone's life.	I have donated before to the charity.	I was just about to mention that I never really have donated to any organization.	if there is one i support it would definately be this one.	I am sure there are many ways to help	Yes, absolutely.	I remember when I donated, the foundation sent me an update about how one of the patients was doing.	It felt great to see a little reflection of what my donation was helping to do.	That is amazing!!!	I will absolutely look to donating something later, just because I have always wanted to anyways and now this so why not.	anything helps and It would make me feel better to know that I tried even if it not a big amount, I will donate what I can and continue.	Okay great.	That sounds perfect.	How much would you like to donate now?	It could be any amount from $0 to what your payment for this task would be.	how would i do it now	Well, you would just tell me what you would like to donate out of your $2.	Like I said, it goes to Save the Children and any amount helps.	However, it is completely up to you!	Your time is valuable.	right, well i feel horrible only saying $0 but i will say $0.00 because i want to go the website with my daughter and look it over and then donate there so she can be part of it	Perfect!	That sounds great.	I appreciate you taking the time to look over the website.	OF course, it will be great for all around, my daughter to see that she should do things like this out of kindness and for the children , thank you	Absolutely.	I think it is important to teach our kids from a young age that giving back to others in need is very gratifying and important.	thank you so much!	do i close this window now	Okay sounds good.	Take a look at the site and have a good day!	Bye.	have a great day
20180723-091102_738_live	Hello chat partner!	hi there!	how are you?	Doing alright..	I have a fridge full of food and a roof over my head so I can't complain..	same here!	Not everyone has it so it's good that you appreciate it	yeah..	I do..	my parents were always in a good situation to be able to raise me well.	but there are a lot of kids in the world who arent so fortunate'	i know.	it's so heartbreaking	im working for this organization right now Save the Children, do you know of it?	no, i've never heard about it	its an NGO that helps children around the world.	kind of like those cheesy commercials you used to see on TV, but these guys actually do some really good work	really?	I would like to learn more about this organization.	yah?	have you ever thought about volunteering for something like this?	i actually did but never had a chance to do so	Volunteering is so rewarding.	You get to feel good about yourself and do a good thing at the same time.	But the thing is not everyone has the time to do so cause of work and stuff.. so here is where you can still make an impact with your donations..	i do like to donate to charities and this one sounds good because i want to help children but how do i know they are legit?	well you can't know entirely that they are legit until you come and volunteer, but save the children has a different kind of structure hierarchy, the director takes a minimum salary etc and all the spending is quite transparent, if you wanna check out the website	sure, what's the website?	URL check it out	give me a minute , let me see	if you go to resource library, click on annual support and scroll down	okay, it looks great.	I see they are top rated charity	okay great.	so we usually suggest a monthly donation of $5
20180903-111245_955_live	Hello, have you heard of Save The Children?	I think so, it sounds familiar.	it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.	What exactly do they do?	Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.	What countries has the charity worked in recently?	Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.	Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.	Wow that sounds like a really robust program.	How long has Save the Children been around?	It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.	Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?	I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them.	That is why I'm talking to you today.	These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.	A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.	Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.	For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.	I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.	What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses	Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.	That's pretty impressive!	Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.	We do it for them, not for ourselves.	And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.	I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.	That is very kind!	After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page.	Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?	Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.	Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher.	It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old.	But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.	How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?	As you can see, $1 will change their world.	One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about.	Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people.	This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.	Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?	Yes.	You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number.	You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers.	Thank you for donation, there will never be enough people like you in the world!
20180719-211846_176_live	hi, how are you?	I'm doing well thank you	that good You knew that for every minute that passes, a child under the age of 5 dies as a result of the war in the Middle East	That is absolutely terrible.	Are there any good charities that are helping on this issue?	I recently read from an organization called Save a Children, which works hard to protect these children and needs financial help to continue	How can someone help?	I would be willing to donate my time and perhaps some money.	you can help by donating what you can, you can even help with your win in mturk, I think these children need us now	How exactly does the money help the cause?	What's it spent on?	is super important, help children who live the harsh reality of war, fewer and fewer people help, the money goes to the education, health and safety of these children.	how much would you be willing to donate your payment?	I'd be willing to donate a dollar or two	eso estaria muy bien, entre todos podemos ayudar, la mayoria de los demas trabajadores  donaran todo su pago, estos ni??Â¸?Â£?os estaran agradecidos	Perfect.	How do I donate then?	The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children, you will be deducted from your payment for this task	You need to type faster.	Our HITs are going to expire on us.	I'd rather send the money on my accord, rather than have it deducted.	Where can I go to send it?	come in  URL	Ok i'll check it out.	thank you.	bye, I hope you can donate as soon as possible	I'll donate right away.	thank you.	Are you going to donate too?	Of course, I'm also going to donate	Awesome.	Have a wonderful day.	I hope those kids get the money they need.
20180825-063009_943_live	Hi WOuld you like to donate your payment for this task to save the children?	No, to be honest I am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	I understand that.	But it's only .30 of the money you are saving.	It could do alot of good for Save the children.	I appreciate your position, but what exactly is Save the Children and how do I know that money will truly be used to help kids?	The researchers of this hit will make sure the money goes to save the children.	Save the Children is a world wide organization that helps kids in war torn areas.	It sounds like a good idea, but I often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when I donate I do it to causes that I know about.	If I donated to every cause I would be giving away a lot of money and I already lose 20% to taxes.	Your right, but I'm not asking for much.	It's only .30 cents and It will do alot to help.	What exactly would that 30 cents be used for and how would it help?	What part of the world will it go to?	It would go all over the world!	The money is used to promote childrens rights and provide food and medicine.	I have to respectfully question the necessity -- don't my taxes already go towards billions of dollars of foreign aid?	And why do so many of these countries continually need help?	Well, lets get specific.	Have you seen the kids in Syria?	I have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.	Those kids are growing up in tents and being bombed every day.	True -- but how much money is currently being provided by US and NATO to help?	They have provided the tents.	Still it isn't enough.	The kids there are struggling.	I have to question that they have provided only tents.	Many countries have absorbed many refugees and I am fairly certain that way more aid than tents has been provided.	True, but there - the kids are lucky to get a meal a day.	Save the children helps with that.	It may -- but at this point I really still have no idea what Save the Children is and I would want to research it anyway before I would agree to give money to it.	I think thats a good idea.	Additionally, I am just very skeptical of any organization that asks for money.	I never know who is in charge, who is taking what, and where the money truly goes.
20180825-060212_445_live	Hello!	How are you?	Fine.	What do you know about the charity?	What have you heard people say or have seen online about the charity?	Save the Children helps provide essential basic needs providing for their health, safety, and education internationally.	Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it?	I have not.	I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.	As of Feb 2018 they were rated 97% transparant and an 88% total rating.	They save children from horrible fates like starvation.	Something simple and easy to fix.	No child should ever lose their life for lack of food.	I'd prefer a secure food donation that directly transports to the areas the children live in instead of handing over to government officials.	I feel that using money to but food directly in their cities is best.	Save the Children donations go straight to the needy.	There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence	I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.	That is incredibly generous!	We all play a role in helping this cause save lives.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I will donate 10 cents.	Thank you!	You donation combined with others always makes a difference.	I feel good about this.	How much do you agree to?	I will match your donation.	Feel free to puruse  URL for more information.	o.k. 20 cents for now agreed and regular for 6 months, o.k.?	I agree to those terms.	(1, o.k. let's say 1600 dollares total, o.k.?	Yes.	It is great that we are willing to share with the needy.	o.k. agreed 1800 dollares done	16.00s was agreed.	Thank you for participating!	o.k. task done
20180719-204358_391_live	Hey there, glad we can talk tonight.	Hello, same!	I'd like to talk to you about something that's very dear to me.	Do you have a moment?	Yeah, totally.	Go ahead	What was it like for you growing up?	Were your basic needs met like food, place to live, water, etc?	Well, I grew up in a wealthy house.	My mother and father both have a PhD so their jobs made possible for us to be able to cover all that and so much more	You are very lucky.	I wish all kids could have that kind of opportunity.	So do I, I feel kind of guilty to being able to have all that and they are kids out there who don't have not a single one of all of those basic things	No need to feel guilty.	People don't have a choice of who or where they are born to.	Those of us who got lucky, can always lend a hand in our own ways.	What do you think?	I totally agree, I think if you can, you should help others in need	I'd like to tell you about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard about them?	Not really, please tell me anything!	They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Oh, that's totally awesome!	Do you donate to this organization?	I do actually, because they're the reason my parents were able to come to America.	Oh wow, that's really heart moving, it's sounds like a lovely organization	They are and I'd like to try getting more people to be aware of them and maybe help.	Would you be interested?	Yeah, totally!	I already help an organization but would be glad to help another one too.	I'm so happy to hear that!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Maybe 0.50?	I'm sorry that it seems so little, but as I already donate to an organization and I use the payments here to save for a vacation coming up...
20180826-175853_545_live	do you know Save the children?	No, I am not very familiar with that charity.	Its very important.	Provide health assistant for kids in need	It sounds like a meaningful charity.	It is.	Every child must have health care and food to put in their bellies	Is it world wide.	Yes they are everywhere.	I saw a kid die in my hands once.	It was horrible	Wow, that is intense.	THanks to Save the children.	The number of death worlwide has been reduced	That is incredible, glad to here this charity exists.	HAve much money do you waste on candy on a monthly basis?	I don't eat candy.	I am sure that you should be spending money in something you dont really need	I am on a very tight budget.	Can you donate something to the children today?	I can donate .10 of my mturk earnings.	Thats great news!!!.Children will be grateful	That sounds great!	The organization will make good use of your money	I am so glad to hear that!
20180826-073320_803_live	Hi there!	I am looking for donations for the Save the children's Foundation?	Could I interest you in that?	I would perhaps be interested can you tell me more a bout it	It is a charity that helps hungry children in need.	It is a international, non governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides releif and support children in developing countries.	That sounds great, What countries do they help children in?	There's quite a few! It's international.	Even the smallest donation would make a difference to a child in need.	Ok I would like to see if I can help. I love children.	That's great!	They are the future you know...	alot of the children are in war zones and facing daily threats of violence.	Of course nothing gets me more angry then seeing a child warrior soldier.	Will we also be helping children soliders?	There are no children soliders, only children that need help in some way with food, resources, emergency response, etc.	This program has saves a great deal of lives.	It has brought families together and gave hope to a new life.	Ok thats great.	Do they need clothes as well?	Yes! Alot of the proceeds go towards garments, shoes, and other things for the children.	Some of them are basically naked and have nothing.	Others have no shoes.	It's really sad, but that's why there are programs out here like us to step in and provide help.	Ok well I know it is important for them to have basic needs.	I hope the money donated goes directly to them and not in the pockets of those running the organization.	Are you certain that the money will be used the right way?	86.5% of it goes towards support program services.	And it is also tax deductible	That sounds like a good percentage and Im glad it will give me a tax break as well.	How do you receive payments?	credit card? cash?	You can donate stock or mutual funds, you can mail it in to a designated address, you can make a payment online with a debit or credit card, PayPal is also an option, there are a ton of ways to get it done!	Wow that is a lot of options.	What would you say is the amount of a the common donation that  someone like myself would donate.	I am ready to donate today and would like to know an acceptable donation.	Anything is acceptable!	Whatever you feel comfortable!	Just keep in mind that the children out here need you!	I would suggest $20 a month if you can! If not, whatever you can spare.	Ok I would like to donate the $20 a month but I would like to hook it up to a credit card that is automatically deducted	That's totally fine!	Please visit us at  URL to read more and make your first donation!	Ok, thank you so much for your help.	You have made this a good learning experience and I feel confident in my donation to Save The Children.

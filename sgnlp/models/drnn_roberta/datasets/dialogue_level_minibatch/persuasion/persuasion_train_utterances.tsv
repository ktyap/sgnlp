20180808-024552_152_live	Hello how are you doing	I'm doing ok	Have you heard of Save the children?	it's an organization that helps support kids impacted by warzone violence	Can't say I have	They are a good group.	Last week CNN talked about the genocides starting in syria	That doesnt sound very good	It's awful.	ESpecially since children are being specifically targeted for rape and torture.	Some are being sold to ISIS	Always with ISIS.	Why can't people just help each other out?	Right?	Save the Children, the organization i mentioned before has been helping out a lot in the region.	They have been saving 250 kids/week.	They want to do more but lack funding	I think lack of funds is always a moot point, because there's never enough	True, but nothing and something are pretty different things.	Especially to a kid that is facing a future as a sex slave.	I donated a couple bucks last week.	It seemed grimy not to	Fair enough, but not everyone has the means to give	That's true, not everyone has the means to give.	But I think most can donate a dollar	Ah, yes, the "if everyone gave a dollar" argument.	It is what gave birth to the whole crowdfunding platform.	It's not an argument.	It's a fact that small donations by large numbers of people can have an impact.	The merit of the cause is an entirely different matter?	Indeed, but how do we know the donation aren't simply buying another yacht for an executive?	A review of the tax exempt paperwork and financial statements, which are available for all tax exempt organizations, can help you weed out good from bad.	Save The Children is transparent	Maybe, but financial statements are always "summaries" and not everyone is fluent in legalese	I think you sell people short, especially since we are talking about numbers in a table.	People can see where the numbers go.	I'm not sure what 'legalese' you refer to.	And these statements are not summaries.	They detail how every dollar is spent, as required by law.  =)	How much are you going to donate?	Unfortunately, I will not be making a donation today.	As they say, don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm.	Hmm, hope you don't ever need help one day...
20180825-053544_897_live	Hi!	Good morning!	Good morning!	How are you doing today?	I am good!	I am trying to get my friends and others to donate their payment from this task to Save the Children.	Save the Children is reputable and every dollar they raise goes to feed families.	What else can you tell me about the charity?	Which countries do they work in?	Save the Children works for 18 countries in Africa, 5 countries in the Middle East and India and Pakistan.	How much of a donation would one have to make to feed a family for a week?	5.00 a week would feed one family for a week.	Do you spend 5.00 a week on a coffee?	That's crazy!	I spend more than that on coffee every week!	Then would you be willing to donate all of the money you make on this hit to the organization?	You could always donate more.	It is our moral responsibility to help feed the hungry.	I would do that	That's awesome!	We are so lucky to live in a country where there is help available to us such as Medicaid, food banks and other organizations to help us.	It is so unfair that any person in any country can go hungry,	We really are.	We have SO many places to go to for help	Yes, we do.	I hope that each of us can make a conscious decision to start donating some of our paychecks each week to help children and families around the world.	I'm going to tell more people about the charity	That is great!!	That is what we need!	Do you live in the United States?	Yes, I do	Me too!	I am going to Kenya in December and I may try to see if there is anywhere there that I can donate some money.	Wait, I should just go through Save the Children since I know they are reputable.	I always prefer going through organizations I have researched to make sure they're reputable as well	Exactly!	Well, it was nice to meet you and thank you for agreeing to donate today!	Thank you, have a great day!
20180826-054344_65_live	Would you be willing to donate your proceeds to the Save the Children organization?	Certainly as long as I know the donation will help the children	This is a fine organization.	I have done some research and the majority of the proceeds go directly into helping the children.	I would certainly be willing to donate then	How much are you willing to donate?	I would be willing to donate $200	That is very generous.	Would you be willing to donate a bit more.	Say $500?	From what I have learned, by donating $500, another organization will match the donation with a minimum $500 donation.	I would certainly increase my donation if it would be matched since the majority of it is going directly to the children	That's wonderful!	So I can count on you for the $500 donation?	Yes you can count on my donation	Thank you so much,  you have no idea how much this will help the children in need!	Thank you Glad I was able to help  this organization with my donation	Do you have any friends or coworkers you might be willing to donate as well?	I could certainly ask some of my coworkers and tell them about the match if they donate at least $500 and tell them what a worthy cause it is.	Or how about an office pool to raise money?	We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations	Ok, that makes sense.	Anything you could get in donations would certainly help.	It doesn't have to be a full $500 donation.	Alright I will ask my co-workers	Thank you again for your willingness to help with this wonderful organization!	Glad I was in a position where I was able to help
20180826-061846_932_live	Hi! How are you doing today?	Good how are you?	I'm pretty good.	Have you ever heard of the Save the Children organization?	I have heard of that organization.	I have seen a lot of commercials on TV for it.	I hear you.	That is when I first heard of it as well.	I love the fact that it is a non-government organization that promotes children's rights and helps to provide the support in those developing countries.	Agreed.	Any organization who promotes rights for those who don't have the platform to speak up is a wonderful charity.	I guess now I am going to sound like the tv commercial but have you ever thought about donating to the organization?	I have thought about it in the past.	I understand that.	With all the organizations out there it is hard to tell a good one and a bad one.	This organization helps to children with their rights to health, education, and even safety.	Yes it is hard to tell whose interests really lie in the movement they promote.	I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs.	Yeah I totally understand that.	I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting.	It breaks my heart.	Absolutely.	It makes you look at your own children (if you have any) and think if that was them how would I cope?	It's the reason I go to work everyday.	To make sure that they have all that they need, and more than I ever had.	I completely understand that.	I have a little girl and it only makes me want to do more and more for her.	Did you know that you can donate a little to the charity today?	I did not.	Oh gosh you totally can.	Whatever you are making for your task payment you can choose to send so much of that to the Save the Children organization.	You can choose whatever amount that you want.	How do I do that?	I would like to give 100% of the task payment.	After we are done talking they should ask you if you would like to donate some and you can enter in whatever amount you want.	The research team gathers all the donations and send it all to Save the Children.	Awesome.	I will do that.	Oh gosh, that is so great of you.	Even just a little helps them so very much.	You are doing a wonderful thing but you and someone else.	Now when you see those commercials you can feel good that you did something to help.	Yes, it will be nice to know that I was able to give to them.	Well I hope you have a wonderful day and on behalf of the charity and the children it is going to, thanks for your help.
20180827-030633_256_live	hello how are you	hi i am fine..	what do you know about the non-for-profit organization save the children	they really doing a great job..	they are real missionaries and humans, provide help to help many children around the world	absolutely i will support them.	tell about your life	my life is going good.

20180826-070022_438_live	HI.	Do you know about Save the Childre organization?	I've heard of them but other then that no not much how about you?	I have.	They help children in need	Well, that's a noble cause don't you think	Of course.	I have seen kids dying of hunger in those countries at war.It breaks my heart	I can imagine, that is horrible.....	to not be able to eat, or drink, and worry about being sick all the time	They are children.They did not ask fot this.	well, I can't imagine anyone would much less a child....	How much money do you spend on candy?	not much maybe a couple dollars every few months	Well that can make a difference in a children life	I donate sometimes well, to other charities	This one ensure that children get the money	That's always good, it's not good to donate somewhere that they don't give to what they're supposed to be donating to	Of course not.	Many children in war zones are struggling	Horrible, I know.....	war is like adults acting like children but worse because they know they're not showing regard to the people suffering	Are you commit to the cause?	Of course I'll donate something	how much are you willing to donate today?	I'll donate $0.05
20180723-091508_49_live	Would you like to donate some of your earnings to the charity Save the Children?	Yes, I would be willing to donate a fraction of my earnings to Save the Children.	How much of the $2 payment for this task would you like to donate?	I would be okay with donating $0.10 from the task payment towards the charity.	Sounds good.	It will (supposedly) be directly taken from your payment and donated to the charity.	Okay.	What does the charity do/what are my funds going to be used for?	They promote children's rights, provide relief, and support kids in developing countries. More information can be found at  URL	Interesting.	Do you know about any of their recent projects?	In 2017 they sent health experts to the Malawi to resuscitate and care for babies with low birth weight.	379,000 babies were cared for by these experts, and 19,000 of them had been successfully resuscitated.	That's very impressive, I am glad that I am donating this charity now that I know more about them.	Right?	They seem like a good charity.	Thank you for your donation!	Thank you for your time, and for the opportunity.	You're very welcome!	Thank you for chatting with me.	You're welcome!	Thank you also.	I hope you have a nice day!	Are you planning anything exciting this week?	Besides working in the morning, I plan to go out to a concert with a few friends on Saturday, so that should be fun.	Ooh nice.	I hope you have a nice time!	I don't really have anything planned this week yet.	That's fine.	I hope you still have a good week!	I didn't really do that much last week, but it was still relaxing.	I'm glad you had a relaxing week!	And thank you, I'm sure this week will be relaxing for me as well.	I hope you enjoy!	Thanks again for chatting with me.
20180808-032124_114_live	Have you thought about how much of the reward for this HIT you want to donate to Save the Children?	I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.	I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.	Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.	I know that it is a good organization and I support them.	However I am not getting a reward from this hit.	I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.	I want the money to do with as I choose.	Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world.	They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.	I still do not want to make a donation from this money.	Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!	Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country.	Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?	Yes I do think that they do.	Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?	I do not want to make a donation today.	Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.	I am not going to waste the reward.	I use it for things that my family needs.	Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money.	Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis.	By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.	We work for everything that we have.	Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.	Of course you work for everything you own.	By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.	It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.	Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping.	So you will really get to know that one child.	It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children.	Everything is completly real and on the up and up.	I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.	Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I will not donate anything $0.
20180826-054028_444_live	Good Morning!	How are you today?	I am good.	It's really nice outside where I am so I am sitting outdoors.	How are you	Oh, that sounds nice.	I am well. It looks nice here today as well.	What are your plans today?	I have to go to work at 11:30-6.	But its ok, I work every Sunday.	So we are supposed to chat about a children's charity.	What are your feelings?	Yes, I was just reading about the charity myself.	I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	It helps kids in need.	I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help.	Can you donate part of today's pay?	Even a bit?	It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.	So I would definitely be willing to help.	Yes, I agree, it is sad.	That is great that you can help!	How much of today's pay can you give?	Also, please include the $ sign with your pledge.	Thank you!	I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?	That is at least something.	I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.	What do you think?	I would love to help as well.	Can you pledge with the $ sign in your next reply.	Also, I agree, the gov't should do more.	And thanks for asking me too.	So lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus.	I would say that is a wonderful idea.	If you are willing to give then I will too!	Nice!!!	It's not a huge amount but unfortunately I have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	Do you have kids?	Yes, I do.	I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own.	Have you visited the Save the Children website?	I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.	I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	It really upsets me	I looked at the site.	Have you heard about the recent storms/flooding in Hawaii?	A little bit but not much.	I have been following politics and things are going crazy.	I am hoping that things will change soon.	Well, it looks like the STC is already to help the children there.	I am amazed by their swift response.	Isn't it really great!	That is great that they are there helping.	Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	Yes, I am sure that is it.	I have to thank you again for your $1 donation.	It will go to great use I am sure.	Do you have any questions about the charity?	Not really.	I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid
20180723-103902_895_live	Save the children is a good organization.	Do you like to donate to charities?	Yes, I do.	What does Save the Children do?	The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Can you give me their website, so I can look into them?	Sure, here is the link.  URL	Thank you!	Why are you talking about this charity instead of the others?	Sure, here is the link  URL	Why are you talking about this charity instead of the others?	I think it is a charity that is well deserving and underfunded.	Children in underdeveloped countries do not have the support that other kids have and I just want to give them a chance to improve their lives.	In what ways do they help children?	They provide things such as food and medical treatment.	Things that are basic needs are given to them.	I'm glad they do that but there are many charities that claim to do the same thing.	Yes, you are correct.	However, this organization has been effective in helping others and all donations are matched.	I believe their goal is to really help the children.	They are known to help in disasters too.	Well, ok.	I'll keep them in mind and do some research into them.	Do you think you would like to donate in future?	If I can vouch for them, yes.	That is great.	I hope you consider them and decide they are worthy	I'm glad there are people like you out there who are attempting to make a difference in the world.	Thank you.	If you had a chance to donate some of your money earned today, how much would you donate to the charity now?	Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from O dollars to all your payment.	I would consider donating $0.50.	Wow.	That is wonderful.	You are a really generous and caring person.
20180824-022709_450_live	Hello, How you doing	Great thanks, Im here to talk about the childrens charity.	Yes, Hope you aware whats going with child who died from hunger	I am mostly aware yes.	This is why i would love to donate an amount.	You are such a good personality ..	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I not sure, how many children are in need of a donation?	This will impact my decision on how much to give.	1000 childrens at the first slot	Right, it will probably have to be 80% of my task payment then.	I'd love to help 1000 children.	Thanks so much.	No problem, what day is the charity meet up then?	We will circulate the information to all the volunteers soon .	Great, and can i bring family members to the donation event?	Sure , everyone are welcome	Great what time is it on?	Falls on morning timeslot and venue details will be shared shortly after we cosolidated the donators	Okay great, is there parking for the venue or should i get a taxi there?	You will have a parking slot available .	However, based on our venue finalization we can check the feasability for everyone.	Thanks.	Just to confirm, I'm donating 80% of my task amount.	sure thanks again	Thanks very much, nice speaking to you.
20180826-174120_426_live	Hi, I would like to speak to you about a wonderful charity called "save the children".	Hey hows it?	Yeah I am interested to hear more.	When you give to Save the Children, you're investing in a future for every last child.Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission ??Â¸??Â¸ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe.	Nearly 90?	Where does the other money go?	The rest?	We use to support the mission ??Â¸??Â¸ running our programs and raising funds to help more children.	Well that is good.	I like that information out there.	Giving to Save the Children is one of the world's best investments.	Changing children's lives now.	Transforming the future we all share.	There are many charities for children than just that one.	In 2017 alone, Save the Children reached more than 155 million children in 120 countries, including the U.S.	Results like these are only possible because of giving people like you.	Whether you give a little or a lot.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Wow thats way more than I would have thought.	I know, it is a really great organization.	Do you think you'd be willing to donate today?	Yes I would be willing to donate.	How about $.15 today?	I can do that	Awesome, you are making a world of difference for children around the world.	Well it is not much but if everyone would give a little it would make a huge difference in this world we live in.	You're absolutely right.	Most people would not even notice the money missing.	Right on so I will give $0.15  :)	I will match your contribution.	That is what I like to hear!	I hope you have a wonderful day.	Thank you for your kindness.	You too,  was a pleasure!

Hot, and well, I think the sun is coming around	Yes, it looks like today is going to be warm here as well.	What are your plans for today?	Mostly working on surveys, so how do you feel about children's charities?	I was going to ask you the same.	Have you heard of Save th Children and the work they do?	Yeah, I think mostly everyone has, I think charities are mostly good but I don't know that they always accomplis all they could well, with expenses and all	Well, STC is a great one!	They help a vast amount of kids.	You have a chance to help today by donating even a small amount of your pay.	As little as $0.05 would be of great help or how much ever you would like to donate from this bonus.	Are you able to lend a helping bit?	sure, I'll donate $0.05.....	I am so glas!	Thank you.	Have you heard about the storms/flooding in Hawaii?	yeah, horrible huh?	My uncle used to be located there but he's moved since	Yes, very bad.	But the good news is that STC is already  ready to help out!	Have you ever been on their website?	no, can't say I've been	I went on and looked around.	They are helping so many that otherwise would be starving.	Do you have kids in your family/extended family?	I don't personally I have a niece, and lots of cousins	I have kids and a few nieces and nephews, and lots of cousins too!.	It would really break my heart to see them suffer.	So, I never did ask, what are your plans for the day?	Mostly working on surveys	Oh, that is something for me too.	So, just to confirm, I can count on you for a donation of $0.05, right?	yes, I can do that.....
20180904-043300_214_live	Hi!	How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well.	Just recovering from the long weekend.	How about yourself?	I am doing well thank you and same here	Awesome.	What are some of your hobbies?	Well one hobby is volunteering.	I wanted to talk to you about a charity Save the Children, have you heard of it?	Only in name.	I haven't heard too much about it though.	Can you tell me more?	It is a charity that helps ensure children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc. all over the world	What do you do as a volunteer for this charity?	Well I volunteer for another nonprofit organization, but I guess I am a volunteer in a way trying to encourage people to donate money.	even a few cents can add up!	Hmm, I see.	Do you have information about their charity rating?	How much of the donation will actually be used to help the children?	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to Save the Children.	It is a trustworthy organizaition that will use your donation to the fullest	I always like to see some report first.	Maybe I will have to do some research first.	Have you donated to them yourself?	You can find more information at their website,  URL	I actually have not yet.	How did you come to find out about this charity?	This conversation actually, but any charity that helps children is alright in my book	You never know though.	I've heard of poorly run charities that misuse the donations.	Like only 50% of your donation actually helps children.	You gotta make sure your donation is helping the needy.	you are very right, and I wish I could give you more solid proof, but I do not hae it	What is the other nonprofit that you support?	A local one that helps children with trauma and hx of sexual abuse	That's nice of you.	Can't ever imagine hurting kids
20180824-130121_505_live	hey	Hi there.	hellow person_2 do you know why you are here?	We are here to talk about a childrens charity.	I don't know which one and presumably talk about a donation to said charity.	yea, that's correct!	Jude's Hospital In Memphis, TN is an amazing children's charity	have you also heard about  URL	No but I just copied the link and am going to look at it now.	their charity will take any amount of payment, if you are interested	I don't have much money at all.	I'm lucky to feed myself and my children, but I believe I could probably manage to send $5	that will be great, and make a lot of people happy	I hope so.	So are we agreeing to send $5 to save the children?	lets save the children,yea	Okay.	So what do we do now?	first we will have to wait a couple a minutes	I think that what is happening with Save The Children is a good idea.	I especially like the Send A Girl To School program.	i love that idea too!	now everyone has an opportunity.	Exactly.	Often time little girls are left behind in third world countries.	Very, very sad.	indeed, it\'s very sad many children have to endure these conditions, just as a friendly reminder "How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment."	I will donate 25 cents of the 75 cents of this task.	Ok Great!	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.
20180827-034916_910_live	Hi there!	How are you today?	I am fine how are you?	I am doing really great.	What are your plans for the day?	well I have to go to work in a little while here how about you?	Ah, yes.	Same here.	That is why I am up so early.	I have to go into the office, do you as well, or can you work from home?	I  work in an office setting as well, I guess we are to talk about childrens charity's.	Do you donate to any on a regular base?	I was just getting ready to ask you if you would be willing to donate some of today's payment to Save the Children.	Even a little would help.	How much would you be able to spare?	I usually like to donate to more local charities, this way it seems safer to actually go where it is needed and it is for poor homeless kids around my own area	Well this is a great one.	They are helping everywhere.	You can offer even the smalles amount from today's pay, like $0.05.	Can You help?	I could maybe help can you tell me more about it where is it based out of and how much will actually be used for the cause?	STC is based out of CT.	The money goes toward saving kids from starving and providing essentials.	Can I count on you today?	do you work for them directly how did you get involved in this?	I got involved with thei website.	After knowing how hard they work I was really impressed.	They are already helping the kids affected by the flooding in Hawaii.	I know I have kids and if they were suffering and unable to eat it would just tear me apart.	I understand that, and you guys raise money here on this site?	is that even worth it?	Yes!	It really is.	Even the smallest donation can make a big impact on many children and families.	STC is USA based as well.	Can we count on you?	yes you can you can have my $0.30	Wow!	That is so great to hear.	I really appreciate your help.	Did you have any other questions about STC?	and the money goes complety to the charity or does a part stay for handeling and administration	The money goes directly to the organization in order to help.	The money will have a large impact.	Would you like to have the site info?	yes that would be great I would like to see that
20180719-122534_38_live	It would be really helpful if you donated to Save the Children fund!	What does the money go towards if I donate?	When crisis strikes and children are most vulnerable, we are always among the first to respond and the last to leave.	We ensure children's unique needs are met and their voices are heard.

20180827-033057_106_live	Hello, how are you?	I'm doing well, a little tired.	How are you?	I am fine thank.	are you interested in donating?	Im a perfect world where I had all the resources and money I could stand, I would love to be a philanthropist.	I think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.	I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity.	What about you?	which charity are you passionate about?	I used to donate here and there, but since I\'ve started working on MTurk, I donated few charities though HITs.	Have you heard about "Save the Children" charity?	Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world.	Really sad situation.	I couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids.	Heart breaking.	I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	All my kids love their security blankets.	Do you have any kids?	No i do not have any kids, but I have a soft heart for kids.	I like how "Save the Children" works on health and educational issues in 120 countries.	There is a good time and place for vaccines.	Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food.	Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.	Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	I never heard of them before today, have you?	No I haven't heard.	It is so good that you know a lot about children's charity.	a little help can make a big difference, sometimes a family can live with just $30.00 per month	Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything.	It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity.	It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world.	Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	You have a lot of knowledge, thanks for sharing.	I like the organization that are transparent with their financial reports, specially the ones that collaborate with big companies.	Yea, I think thats most important.	There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities.	Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?	No not really, I know a little about different charities.	I just donate here and there.	I will save the ones you mentioned and will definitely search about them.	I like how these HITs give the opportunity to talk about charities	Ive had a few of the charity HITs.	I like to learn about an array of different things.	I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs.	Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here.	I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	That is awesome.	I have donated to organization that works on some disease through MTurk, like Malaria	I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	yes I did it before.	Actually it breaks my heart to see children in pain.	I think It is good to know donating through this task won't hurt your reward	Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.	McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay.	Ronald McDonald House is the name I think.	I will look for it for sure.	I like it when part of my purchase will be donated.	Thank you for all the information	It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	I think this is the last chat exchange.	Have a good day!	Thank you, you too	I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	Thanks, that is awesome	Thanks, that is awesome
20180825-043341_782_live	Hi, how much do you like to donate to the charity now	I would definitely donate because I often donate to charities	This donation will go to Save the children	This is a worthy organization because many children receive some benefits	Can you specify the amount of donation	I would donate $10 to this charity	ok fine.	The research team would collect the donations	ok great-who is the research team?	The researxh team will contact you	Ok-thanks-I will be waiting to hear from them	Fine anything you want to know about the Save the children	I have seen information about this organization before	To brief you again Save  the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yes, it is a worthy organization and I do believe that it helps in many substantial ways.	Donation to this organisation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	The donations to heal and help with health issues is very crucial	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Yes- the war in Syria had traumatized many children	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	yes, I think I have told about my donation and now waiting for the conversation to end.  Thanks.
20180723-094242_630_live	Hi, how are you today?	I am okay.	How are you?	i'm doing great!	I'm working for Save The Children organisation, have you heard about it?	No, I haven't.	Can you tell me more about it?	sure.	Save the Children is an international NGO that promotes children's rights and provides relief and helps support children in developing countries	What types of programs does it offer?	they ensure children's rights to health ,education and safety.	They are currently helping Syrian children	On my side I don't have information about the task, only that we are trying to come up with a donation agreement.	Are you looking for a donation for the charity?	yes, You can donate as little as 1 cent and as much as 2 dollars.	your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment	Okay, that is good to know.	What types of things are being done to help the children in Syria?	1000 children were killed or injured and the donations can address these problems.	Our organization gives shelter to those kids, feed them and take care of them	Do you know what percentage of donations goes directly to programs (as opposed to overhead costs, salaries, and expenses)?	yes, 86% of all the donations goes to programs and the rest goes to maintaining the fund, ads, etc	That sounds pretty good.	What other countries are they working in right now?	They are actually helping children at the US Mexican border to reunite with their parents	What inspired you to work for Save the Children?	I have a son and I can't imagine seeing him hungry or in pain or afraid of being killed.	i want to help all the children in the world	That's an honorable reason. :)	What is the one thing you would say to someone to encourage a donation?	a couple of cents or a couple of dollars might not make a difference in your life but it can make a huge impact on some child's life	That is a good way to think about it.	And every little bit can add up.
20180827-021816_456_live	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Some what I familiar with charity.	What about you?	I am, Save the Children is a wonderful, greatly needed charity.	Donations to this charity are essential to ensure at-risk children receive health care, education, safety and much more.	So nice job.	I also like to save the children.	That is wonderful!	I just wanted to make you aware that you have the opportunity to donate a portion, or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children.	This donation will aid in giving at-risk children a chance for hope.	Yes I also like to donate to the children without parents and relatives.	Wonderful.	I'm glad to know you agree with Save the Children's values.	Before I ask you for the amount you'd like to donate I want to give you a bit more info about the charity and answer any questions you might have.	Save the Children has received top ratings for achieving incredible results for children.	Save the Children does what it promises.	I like to donate.	But I don't have money to donate.	You would choose an amount from the money you make completing this task.	Your donation would make a difference to children among 120 countries, including the United States.	I like to donate 50 dollars.	What about you?	That is a generous donation!	But I believe that exceeds what you will receive for this task.	You can choose an amount anywhere from $0 - $0.30	I choose 0.30 dollar for donation	Awesome!	I want to let you know that your donation will be collected by the research team and will send it to Save the Children.	Do you have any other questions about the charity?	Ok if you need means you take that amount.	Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.	Save the Children assists these children with their education, protection and emergency programs.	We must help the children to give education.	Yes we must.	Your .30 donation will certainly assist these children.	Save the Children is also transforming the lives of Africa's children.	Ok done.	What Dollar you need to give For children charity?	Okay just to confirm how much would you like to donate to Save the Children?	What about you?
20180825-054948_621_live	Hello	Hi.	I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?	Oh.	There is this children's charity my friend volunteers for.	It's called Save the Children.	Have you heard of it?	I think so.	Does it have commercials on tv?	Yes, they do.	I wish they didn't have to spend their monies on commericals but it is the only way to get their name out there.	Does this charity help children in the United States, or do they deal mostly with children in African nations?	It is a global charity.	They help out children in the US and around the world.	You should check out their website:  URL s/what-we-do/us-programs	I will copy and save the website address.	What do volunteers do for this charity?	I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.	My friend is a nurse and she takes a month off every year to go to Africa to help out.	I would love to do that but can't possibly get that much time off.	How about you?	That is awesome that your friend does that!	I'm not a nurse though, and couldn't possibly travel to Africa or anywhere else.	Well, the next best thing is to donate.	You don't have to give much.	A few cents a month is all it takes to help change a child's life.	Would you be willing to donate?	No, I honestly don't have any money.	If I did have extra money, I would probably donate to St Jude's.	I have given a few extra cents sometimes at the checkout in grocery stores.	I know money is tight.	It sure is for me too.	I only ask you to think about whether you buy any unnecessary things like a starbucks coffee every day.	I know there are often times I regret spending money on that when there are starving kids in the world that could be helped.	Do you ever feel that way?	No, not really.	I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.	Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.	I understand.	The research team is collecting donations, so if you are willing to give even a few cents from your task payment, I'm sure the charity would be appreciative.	I've done that before on other tasks.	Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?	Yes, they are doing what you've described.	So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give "Save the Children" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.	Yes.	I hope you have a great rest of your day.	Thank you, you too.
20180903-132332_521_live	hi there!	How was your weekend?	It was pretty good, hot weather but still nice and yours?	hot here too.	I did a 5k fun for save the children charity.	have you ever heard of it?	No, I can't say I have.	What is it about?	I'm excited to tell you about it! it is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	In what way does it support children?	There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?	exactly.	The war torn area is just one of many examples of places where kids need support.	It's great to help.	every little bit counts!	Does this money provide help for the kids in their own country or is it used to bring these children over to the United States?	to help in their countries.	They also help kids here in the USA too.	would you consider making a donation?	even something small would help.	I'm sorry I'm just not able to at this time but thank you for telling me about this organization.	I wish you well.	Even 1 penny? 1 penny would be minimal and would greatly help.	Alright, I will donate 25 cents.	wow! thanks on behalf of the organization! that is generous!	You're very welcome.	what else do you have planned for the labor day?	We went out with family to eat and are just taking it easy and yourself?	going out to eat is always a fun way to spend time together.	I went to the movies to see crazy rich asians.	It was good.	It sounds like fun.	I recently saw a old movie at the theatre called Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart.
20180825-111850_152_live	Good afternoon.	Hey there how is it going?	It's going alright.	I've just been reading about a charity called Save the Children.	Have you heard of it?	I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.	From what I've read, it's a nonprofit that helps children in difficult situations around the world.	I was reading about their aid work in Syria and how they've helped young girls in developing countries receive schooling.	Oh wow!	That's incredible.	I wasn't aware that they did all of that.	This morning, I was also reading about an ebola outbreak in the Congo (I think).	I imagine they'll help there if they aren't stretched too thin.	So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!	It is!	Do you ever donate to organizations like this?	My brother, sister, and I replaced birthday gifts with charity donations a few years ago.	It saved on clutter and felt great to give to charities.	I've given to a few charities before, but never this one.	I'm always so skeptical of charities to be honest.	Same here.	I remember reading about some questionable charities following hurricanes in Haiti and Puerto Rico.	It's a bummer when that money gets siphoned off.	I just looked up Save the Children on Charity Navigator and they give the org an 88.3 rating out of 100 including a 97 for transparency.	Wow that's a really great rating!	I think money that goes to kids is a super important cause.	I plan on giving my payment for this exercise to Save the Children based on my research.	Would you like to donate to the charity as well?	After we are done chatting, I think you can tell them the amount you want donated.	Hmm, I would like to, but I'm having some financial trouble at the moment.	I'm not sure how much I'd be willing to donate.	I think you can donate as little as one cent.	Sorry to hear about your financial troubles!	I've been in a similar boat recently.	Do you think that small of an amount would really help someone?	I like to think so, yes.	I know that organizations always stress that every little bit counts.	I'd like to think that even a few cents from a lot of people would be helpful.	I think I'd be willing to donate about 25 cents	Awesome!	I'll match your donation.	Oh that's great and makes me feel better!	Thank you!	I have to get going.	It's been great chatting with you and I hope you enjoy your weekend.	I have to get going.	It's been great chatting with you and I hope you enjoy your weekend.
20180808-022005_838_live	Hello, how are you today.	Very well, thank you.	And you?	I'm great, thank you.	I'm wondering if I can have a moment of your time to talk to you about a charity program I work with?	Sure.	Go right ahead.	Thank you.	I'm hoping you would like to donate some of your task payment to the charity 'Save the Children', and organization that promotes children's rights and supports children in developing countries.	I would be interested in doing do, however I must tell you I am generally very skeptical about charity orginizations in general.	I know of many that I do not support due to the 6 figure salaries of the CEO.	And the fact that not much of the donation actually get to the "cause".	I completely understand the skepticism due to a tenfold of shady organizations these days.	However, I can guarantee you Save the Children is a professional organization that promises their donations go to a trustable fund to support international children's causes.	You have my attention, however this HIT is running Very long for 2 bucks already.	So can I conclude that you'd like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	No, you may not draw that conclusion yet.	I still know nothing about the charity and I\'m already a half hour into a 2 dollar HIT.	I do not do this "only" for the money, but to try and help any way I can.	That\'s the only reason I\'m still here.	I can understand that.	So i'd really like to thank you for your interest and time.	I can assure you if you donate as little as a penny to this charity you can be part of the solution to put an end to children's struggles from all over the world.	I have been doing some research while waiting for your responses.	I'll donate .50.	Thank you so much.	Your donation is very much appreciated.	You are welcome.	It would be more, but not without more research.	This HIT is a rip off, taking far too much time.	I am an old retired guy with limited income.	My wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	Pennies matter to me.	I'm sorry to hear that, but I assure you that your humble donation will not go unrecognized.	Thank you again.	Thank you.	I just hope the donation does help and do wish it could be more.	The research team will collect your .50 donation and send it to Save the Children.	Thank you.	Most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	Thank you, you too sir.	Should this HIT not be ending, I think it has had more than 10 rounds?
20180826-220838_141_live	hello	Hello tell me something good	Have you heard about this awesome children's organization called Save the Children?	a little, what do they do?	They are a very reputable international non-governmental organization dedicated to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	cool, so what can i do	The easiest way you can become involved with the organization initially is with monetary support.	ok so wht do you suggest?	The easiest would be is to donated some or all of your incoming payment from this task today.	not so fast what does the money go to	As I mentioned previously, for ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	For example Save the Children was one of the first to provide assistance after the Puerto Rico hurricanes to children whose parents had died in the storms with food and shelter.	oh wow ok how much do you suggest?	You can choose any amount from a few cents up to the full amount you'd get for the task today.	ok  $1 it is	Now I know I said any amount, but given the great cause this is, can you spare any more today?	If you'd like to reconsider and read more about the organization you can view their website here :  URL	nope 1 is cool	I could try to persuade you more, but it seems your mind is fairly set in place.	Just remember it's not about doing better for ourselves, it's for the next generations that follow us.	oh ok then $50	That is very generous of you.	The organization is going to be so pleased that they can provide an even more widespread reach with your generous donation.	ok thank alot	Just to confirm for the organizational leaders and the formal record, you are donating $50 to Save The Children today?
20180904-004818_580_live	Have you heard of the charity Save the Children?	Yes I have, but I don't know a lot about it.	They promote children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	That sounds like a very nice cause.	Yes, it\'s a great cause.	And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.	Including an "A" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.	That's awesome!	Do you know when the charity began?	It was founded way back on April 15, 1919!	A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.	Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!	That is very impressive.	Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?	The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.	That is awesome.	I know I was surprised by those numbers.	A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.	That's important to me in a charity.	Yes, definitely.	Unfortunately some "charities" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.	That's the truth.	That's why it's so important to do research before donating.	Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.	For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.	It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.	Super helpful.	That's very helpful.	It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money.	That way nobody can question anything.	Oh yeah.	When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.	Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs!	The rest goes to "fundraising, management, and general" as the website says.	That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets.	Right.	I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.	Exactly.	It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.	I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.	Have you ever donated to charity in the past?	Yes I have.	I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.	The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.	That is so special.	That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.	How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?	You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.	You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.	I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.	Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.	That is awesome!	Nice move.	That's some good karma for you right there, and knowledge that your money is going to help children around the world.	Thanks for doing your part!
20180829-084042_694_live	hi	how are you today?	so you gonna donate or what	sure I can donate but what is the game?	you gotta donate your payment	If I donate, what do I get in return?

Don't i sound human, what kind of AI talks like this.	Also, im skeptical to see if youre actually human.	tell me a joke to prove it.	robots cant laugh, a im sure you know	That's true.	I do believe you are human based on the conversation.	I'll donate a $1.	sounds good thanks	Hopefully it is for a good cause and not just a waste.	its for a good cause, im not a complete asshat	that's good.	you do have to be skeptical though	I hear ya.

Hopefully we can move on soon to get back to other tasks.
20180808-021732_428_live	hello	hello how are oyu	I have a special, special request for a special person like you.	ok great i have one for you also.	i'm sure you love children, right?	Absolutely, and I'm sure you do too.	of course or i wouldnt be online!	so have you ever considered donating to a charity for kids	I was thinking the same thing, actually.	Have you heard of the group named Save the Children?	Oh yes, I have heard that they do very important work!	It's so sad that so many children are dying in developing countries and war zones.	It makes me furious.	Me too, if only we could help!	I head of one child who was in the middle of a war-torn city in Syria, who was cut off from food and water, and died.	That is very sad.	I would like to donate money to a charity to help this cause	That's very, very nice of you!	As we need to maximize help I would recommend you donate a maximum amount.	I think we should donate at least 17 dollars but less than 19 dollars	So you think that you want donate around 18?	That sounds like a generous donation, of course you could do more.	I could maybe do less as well?	How about 15?	Well, less is okay, but to help the maximum amount of kids then a maximum amount would be good.	I would say 20 dollars.	If you can stomach more then go for it!	That sounds good.	I agree to 20	That sounds good.	This will help many kids!	A few bucks goes a long way in these places.	hopefully many more people help out so that they can get food and medicine
20180826-040651_411_live	Hello, how are you today?	hello i am fine thank you	Have you heard of our charity Save the Children?	yes I've donated $ 150 to this year for this organization	Awesome, you know all about it then!	I know more or less how it works and my goals are, but what do you know	I know it is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights while also providing relief and support for children in developing countries.	It is awesome there are people that dedicate their lives to help ensure children have the rights to health, education, safety, and much more.	very fair, it is good that all contribute little to the help of children all over the world	This is very true.	So how do you feel about donating today?	I feel the happiest man in the world when I donate some help if she is, I feel very good when my help is happening to people	This is great to hear, not everybody feels that way!	I do not only help the children but everybody who needs some help if this financial or moral help	It sounds like we need more people like you in the world.	true, we live a life and it would be more fun to live beautifully and happily but not only for ourselves but to be happy for all the people who surround us somewhat	This is true.	Everybody deserves the option to be happy.	We all should have equal opportunity to be happy and succeed in life.	if I define what makes me happy in life is to look and my beloved happy man	That is an awesome definition.	So seeing as how you mentioned you would like to donate today, what is a specific amount you would be willing to donate?	I wanted to buy clothes for myself today, but I will give them some kind of charity online search, full $ 100	That is great to hear, however.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from 0$ to all of your payment.	work here is the other thing, my donation comes from my other payment	That's awesome, so you'd like to donate all of your task payment?
20180827-050740_909_live	Hi!	How are you today?	Feeling great.	Just got back from the gym	nice!	I would like talk to you about a charity today.	Do you donate at all?	I'm pretty poor.	If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.	I am in the same boat.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	No.	I don't believe I have.	It's an organization that raises money for children all over the world in need, such as children from war torn countries like syria	I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.	See, I believe that the children are our future.	If we don't help them now, they won't have the life they deserve.	One could be the next president or something!	I've lived for 76 years and have only experienced two reasonably good presidents.	The way things are going I don't expect to experience any thing close to that again.	Ha, well maybe not the best example currently...	but a few cents can go a long way	My few cents would never go toward a children's charity.	If I have anything it will go to homeless shelters, food pantries and environmental causes.	I do agree the money should go more towrads the whole family, but some children have lost their families, and have been left with nothing.	They may end up being homeless and going to food pantries.	Maybe we could prevent that from happening	That would be real low on my list of priorities.	People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.	Well i hear you.	I think that any donation to anyone is helpful in this world.	It should be specialized	I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.	Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.	You make a very good point, sir, but what if everyone felt that way!	then the children would get nothing!	That really wouldn't bother me at all.	well like I said, any donation is a good donation.	thank you for donating	I'm not donating to your children's charity.	How much are you donating?
20180824-120504_474_live	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	that needs your help right now!	Big issues are going on.	I believe it!	I dont know much about this charity....what else can you tell me about it	You believe, as we do, that every child deserves a future.	Every last child., that is the mission statement.	Yes, I definitely agree... how can I help?	I would like you to donate at least half of your money doing this hit to save children its your moral obligation.	Unfortunately, I cant do that.	I need the money as well	Not as much as the starving children in Syria who don't even have a phone/desktop to do this hit.	Can i donate my time instead?	You can do that locally for certain, but time is money, and right now just a dollar would go a long way in saving lives.	Ok great.	I will look in to donating my time locally, thank you!	I will look in to donating my time locally, thank you!	Well.	I hope you feel guilty for not helping the kids now, because this is just your time.	I do not feel guilty, did you donate?	I am donating everything from this hit, then I'll do another one.	Oh, I didnt know we could do another one?	I'm pretty sure we can and i'm pretty sure that you buy frivolous things that you don't need when the money can be going towards a good cause.	Im pretty sure that if you want someone to donate to a cause you treat them nicely	This isn't my cause, I need to get it through to peoples heads that this is important.	I'm not trying to get money from you in the streets for my own cauase this is for something bigger than you or I	Ok, well use your passion for the cause to speak nicely to people and educate them on why its important	I tried that approach and you disregarded me and told me another time.	if you care for this cause, then me donating my time should be sufficient
20180825-064038_102_live	Hi how are you?	Fine how are you?	I am well	What is your favorite childrens charity	Well I recently heard about Save the Children Charity.	They donate money to help children in developing countries.	Have you heard about them?	Yes I have heard of them.	They do a lot for kids	Yes they do.	They help out a great deal.	My job today is to see if you would be willing to donate any of your earnings to the charity	At this time I am not willing to do that	Okay, well I am supposed to ask you how much of your payment you would like to donate.	Anywhere from zero to the full amount.	So I am to understand you do not wish to help any of them?	Yes that is correct	Okay, well let me give you some details about the charity so we can finish out this conversation.	we need 10 chats each to complete this hit	okay im fine with that	Well one statistic that in 2018 alone over 1,000 children were killed or injured in Syria.	This charity's goal is to help them out.	Thats sad so many children were killes	I know.	I am not sure the exact details but more about their website is  URL	Thanks for the info I will check it out	sorry, i meant  URL	I know, and I'm not really sure if they would deduct any real money.	Many times they say they will and use their own funding based upon our replies.	okay did you choose to donate?	They didn't give me an option, but if they did I would donate the full amount.	Anyways, I believe we've chatted 10 times.	Hopefully our government will do something rather than relying on those of us who are moral to donate.	Have a great day and thanks for the chat!	I understand you too
20180808-074917_388_live	Hi, how are you today?	okay..and how are you	I'm doing great.	Out of curiousity, have you heard of the organization Save the Children?	yes..i am very familiar..	are you involved with charity	Yes!	I really prefer local charities but some nationwide and international ones are very dear to my heart.	Whenever we have the opportunity to donate from our task rewards I always try to give a little bit.	me too..i see many commercials for charity on TV and it breaks my heart..	i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar	Yes, I've heard of Unicef.	Another great organization.	One thing I love about Save the Children is that they have very high ratings from third-party reportings.	I know when I donate to them that my money is being used wisely!	interesting, what do the ratings represent	The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy.	They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going.	very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children	I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now.	There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that.	i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.	I totally understand that.	One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities.	i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?	I typically give less than that, because I also give to my local church and other local organizations in my city.	ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month	Well, I just usually give $20 or $30 to a handful of charities that I love.	But like I said, if the opportunity arises for me to donate some of my HIT reward to a charity, I will usually donate at least a small portion.	Do you ever do that?	i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount	You actually have the opportunity today to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children.	How much would you like to put towards that?	It can be any amount from just $0.10 to the full payment!	hmm..interesting i will consider that..how would i contact them	The research team will collect all donations and send it directly to Save the Children.	You can just type the amount here you'd like to donate and it will be recorded for them to see.	ty..i will contact and agree to start off with 10$ per month	Thank you!	Have a great day!
20180808-064649_236_live	HI GOOD MORNING	Good morning, how are you?	FINE, HOW ABOUT YOU, AND MANY CHILDREN ARE DYING.	I am fine, thanks!	Yes, surely there is a good charity that can help children.	Do you know of a good one?	YES, I KNOW THE BEST CHARITY , THAT NAME IS SAVE THE CHILDREN, DO YOU KNOW THE CHARITY.	Yes, I am thinking of donating to a childrens charity and I can now consider Save The Children.	How much is a good donation that could help?	ITS A VERY GOOD CHARITY, I SO MANY TIMES DONATE THEM THE MONEY ARE ANY THINGS DIRECTLY GO THE CHILDREN ONLY.	Ok, good to know!	Thanks!	I will donate $100 to them today.	Are you going to donate also?	YES I ALSO DONATE 50 DOLLAR TO THEM AND I AM VERY TO DONATE THEM AND THANK YOU  FOR  DONATE.	Do you know what kind of services they will provide with the money?	THEY GIVE THE EDUCATION, FOOD, CLOTHS ,ETC.,	That's great!	I have considered donating to St Jude also because they provide life saving medical care.	Have you heard of them?	YES, I KNOW THAT.	Have you ever donated to them?	YES, I MONTHLY DONATE THE CHILDREN.	That's great of you!	I think I will donate to them today too.	Do you know of any other childrens charities?	I DO NOT THE OTHER CHARITIES.	I am sceptical of many of them but if you recommend Save The Children and I know that St Judd's is trustworthy, then that's where my money will go today	89% MEMBER RECOMMEND THE CHARITIES.	That's impressive.	I wonder what the member recommendation is for St Jude
20180903-134122_237_live	Donate to Save the Children, please.	Think about those poor kids.	Well tell me a little bit more about the charity.	It's really all in the name.	You have a moral responsibility.	A lot of charities are just a name and they don't do what they promise.	How do I know my money will go where it supposed to?	They're a world-famous trustworthy charity.	If they were fraudulent or misallocating funds, surely there'd have been a scandal.	Ok.	So why do they deserve my money as opposed to other charities like St Judes or the Red Cross>	Of course you can donate to other charities.	It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.	I can tell you, however, that Save the Children is, in a way, more immediate in helping people (as opposed to fighting disease like St Jude's) and delivers services similar to the Red Cross, but directed toward children.	So, please: think of the children!	Do they help kids in the US?	I like to help people that are close to home.	Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services.	Though you, being the generous person you are, like helping those at home, is there a reason not to help children abroad?	I don't mind helping those abroad.	But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.	So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.	So we'll agree then: you can do both!	Well how do i make a donation to them?	You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to: http:// URL	well if you aren't going to help me out with information and make it easy on me by helping with info, i'm not sure if you really care	Of course I care.	Let me get that information for you now...	Thanks I would appreciate your help.	People are more likely to donate when they are comfortable and feel like it is good organization.	On the Save the Children Website, there\'s a "Donate Now!" button, as well as large swaths of information regarding their activity, that is, how they use the money!	Ok thank you.	Yes I believe I will donate.	I do think it is a good cause.	Thank you.	You're helping a lot of good kids who really, really need it.	You are welcome.	Even though I can't donate much, at least it will do some good.
20180826-180314_928_live	Hi.	How are you?	Hello, I'm fine.	How are you?	I'm doing well. Thanks.	Have you been using MTurk long?	I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.	It's pretty easy money most of the time.	I'm Tommy, by the way.	Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy.	I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday.	It's great to earn extra money here and there.	I'm glad you're enjoying it.	Well thanks, Cassidy.	It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.	I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.	For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.	And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.	How about you, Cassidy?	Do you like giving to charities?	I do enjoy donating to charities.	I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.	And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university	Aww, that's really considerate of you.	I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.	Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.	I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.	It's really sweet.	Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.	And its awesome that you help out those kids in need	The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know?	I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites.	The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.	It's really really sad what's going on over there.	Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?	Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.	Maybe I'll consider donating to them	Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.	Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?	No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me!	I think I might donate mine too!	I say we do it together!	See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world.	There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.	But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.	How many lives we can help.	What do you say, Cassidy, do you want to join me today in helping these kids?	Yes I do, you've really inspired me Tommy	Great!	That's so generous of you.	How much would you like to donate to them today?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from  zero to the whole .30 cents.	Personally, I'm giving them the full amount.	I'l do 20 cents	Well thats fantastic of you.	I feel like together we made a small difference in the world today.	How about you?	I do too	Well great.	I wish you a happy rest of your weekend.	And it was a pleasure chatting with you today.	It was nice chatting with you too
20180723-082451_335_live	Hi there, how are you doing today?	Hi!	Doing good.	How are you?	I'm doing good.	I was wondering if I could talk to you about donating to Save the Children today?	Yes, of course.	What are they about?	Great!	They're an international organization that promotes children's rights and helps give children aid in developing countries.	That sounds wonderful!	Isn't it?	And we're not asking for a lot, just some or all of your incoming payment for your task.	It's going to a really good cause!	What kind of aid do they give?	They help provide water, give children access to education, give girls tampons so that they can attend school on their period, give them vaccines - things like that.	A couple of organizations claim to do that.	Why should I donate to this one in particular?	You're right.	A lot of organization collect funds and then it goes to administration or advertising and not a lot of money goes to the people who need it the most.	Save the Children makes sure to give as much as they possibly can, because they understand that when it comes to people who are starving, every penny counts.	Is there any concrete proof that they do?	Words are just words sometimes.	I totally understand that!	They have a full list of the percentages that they spend on each thing at  URL so you can see exactly where your money is going!	I am reviewing the site right now.	So what are the amounts for donation accepted?	Thank you so much for even taking the time to consider it!	I know I always feel so selfish when I'm eating lunch and I see a commercial for people who are starving, it just really gets to me and I'm so glad you care about making a difference as well!	You can choose any amount between 0 and all of your payment for this task.	Ok.	I'll donate $0.50.	Are you sure you don't want to donate any more?	Save the Children really appreciates every penny that they get and it really goes to a good cause.	Unfortunately, it is all I can afford at the moment.	I understand that.	Everyone at Save the Children really appreciates your donation!	I'm glad you are fighting for a cause to help others.	It is very refreshing to see.
20180719-181845_211_live	Hello!	How're you doing today?	Hey, kind of tired but overall good.	How are you?	I'm doing alright.	I just had a thought on my mind that I wanted to ask you about	Yea?	Go for it.	Do you donate when you get the chance?	I was thinking about how everywhere you go, they ask you to donate .50 here and your change there.	I think I need to actually start donating.	How does it make you feel?	Do you donate?	I don't like to donate to for profit businesses.	I feel like they'll just take my donation and get their tax credit.	How do you feel about Save the Children?	My nephew had to get taken into the hospital not too long ago and I just got the letter in the mail saying they used Save the Childrens donation money to help him.	I'm thinking about donating to them.	I'm sorry to hear about your nephew?	What happened, if you don't mind me asking.	We found out the hard way that he has actual celiacs (sorry I can't spell too well) and he has an allergic reaction to the cake on his birthday.	He went through a TON of testing and that's how they caught it.	He has to stay overnight at the hospital for a few weeks and his parents just couldn't afford it.	That's when Save the Children came around to help	Oh my gosh.	I am so sorry to hear about the little guy and how his birthday, too.	How did Save the Children help?	They helped cover the bills for it since he's in Africa.	He's doing much better now though!	Oh wow.	All the way in Africa.	I'm really glad to hear that.	You must be so releived.	I am!	I'm thinking about donating to them would you be willing to help?	Sure thing.	What are the amounts I can pick from?	You can choose any amount from 0 to all of you payment	I'll do $20.	Oh man, I can't believe it!	Thank you so much!	Sadly, this task will only let you donate the whole 2 dollars.	If you wanna donate more you can donate through the website!	I'm looking at donating 20 tonight too	Oh I didn't know that.	Thank you for letting me know.	Yeah, I'm just so glad that I know they really help.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I'll still do $20 and go through the site.	Do you want to also donate the 2 dollars from this task?
20180826-033211_245_live	Hi how are you this day ?	Hey, I'm doing great, how are you?	I am very good.	Glad to be doing this survey because it is for a good cause (Save the children) Do you agree ?	Oh absolutely!	I think it's very important to donate to charities.	Yeah I stronlgly believe we should all pitch in and help.	I am 100% sure I am going to donate 80%-100% of my earnings for this survey to (Save the children) It will make me feel good to help Little helpless children.	What do you think you will be donating ?	I don't have the money right now to donate.	I will defiantly be donating at the first of September though.	I will try to donate at least five dollars.	We all need money, but this is a special cause and the money is not too much.	These surveys are a good way for us to get involved and help those in need........Dont you agree ?	Oh yeah defiantly.	Out of the earnings I earn from this survey I would probably donate at least half.	It's only fair.	Wow that is so good to hear it reallly shows that most people are willing to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves.	Yeah it's very important to help someone that is less fortunate than yourself.	Especially if they are children.	Did they tell you "How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment."	At this time I can't donate any amount.	However I will donate later.	I thought you said you would donate a part of your earnings ?	How about I match you on what you decide you can afford to donate.	If you donate 30% I will donate 50% if you donate higher I will increase mine accordingly.	It is a one time thing.	Those kids suffer quite a lot and dont really have anyone to help them.	Sure I will donate 30%.	Awesome.	I know I have never met you ,but I feel so good to be working with you to help someone even if it is such a small amount it makes me feel glad.	Same to you!	Most people wouldn't give anything and it makes me really happy to meet someone that would help with whatever they can.	Yeah I agree 100% with you.	I have been to other countries that are very poor and it is Amazing how much a little donation will make a BIG differance in these childrens lives.	I guess in America you don't really understand what other countries go through.	That's awesome you have been to other countries. I don't mind helping at all.	I live in Florida.	What part of USA are you from ?	North Carolina, I've been to Florida once, it's nice.	North Carolina is nice I have been there once.	Well nice talking to you so I am going to Donate 70% and you will do the 30% .	Good Deal and hope this will help others.	Take care have a great day.
20180826-043247_456_live	Hey!	How are you doin today?	Hey!	I'm doing well!	How are you?	I\'m alright, just reading up on this organization called "Save the Children".. have you heard about it?	I haven't.	It sounds familiar though.	Could you tell me about it?	Yeah, no problem!	It's a non-governmental organization that helps with children's rights.	They claim to provide relief and support to kids in developing countries.	That's amazing.	Do they provide legal help or support to live?	It looks like a bit of both!	But they're down on donations.	Curious, how willing would you be to donate to the cause?	Say... if it were deducted from your task payment?	I'm really passionate about children's rights no matter what background they are from.	When it isn't available, I think it's important to provide for them if we can.	So, I'd be willing to donate, if I could confirm the charity was a legitimate one.	Absolutely!	Save the Children is quite credible, and has tons of information out there about their organization.	They have corporate partnerships, individuals, and foundations!	Oh, wow!	Okay, I would definitely donate to them!	That's so awesome to hear!	How much were you thinkin?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'm not sure how much I would be getting from the task, but I will say $1!	That's so awesome of you!	The research team will be able to collect all donations and send it on over to Save the Children.	It's a very valuable cause, and afterall, they have won up to 7 awards.	Oh, that is nice!	Especially now with so many children separated from their families because of the immigration disputes, I hope they can help children here even in America as well!	They absolutely have United States based programs!	From Avocacy, to Education, and even emergency services.	I worry about those kids too, so I understand.	It's a shame what's going on, I hope the problem gets rectified soon.	Me too.	I think about them so often.	I have a sister who is under eighteen.	I try to teach her about her rights because I think it is so important to know them.	If someone believes they can take advantage of your ignorance, a lot of times, they will.	It's a shame, but I want her to know her rights so that she is never taken advantage of by someone in a higher position of power.	Wherever and whoever that may be.	I want to teach my daughter the same someday!	It's even harder seeing the things going on here on the news and in the media when you have a child that's so close to you :(	Yes.	It makes me scared for her and my nephews as well.	I hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older.	have noticed so many kids that are kinder and more aware than when I was younger.	I think it's because there are more people who have experienced injustice or have been hurt by inequality.	They want to make sure it doesn't happen to the ones that come after us.	I agree!	I think that the internet helps, too.	Helps to bring awareness.	It was very kind of you, today, to donate your earnings from this chat for the kids.	I understand the grind of trying to make a buck, and I just wanted to leave you off with one thing: you heard about saving children and you committed.	That's so big of you, and not many people care these days.	I admire you, and I hope you have a wonderful day. :)	Thank you.	It was nice speaking with you! :)	You as well!	xx
20180825-060648_863_live	Save the Children helps children all around the world and they need your help.	They definitely do.	Do you participate in any local children's charities?	I volunteer at a local food bank.	Many of the families that come to us have young children.	Actions as well as donations help keep the Charity afloat and able to help children around the world	Right.	I used to tutor kids in my spare time in college.	I also tutored kids at a battered woman's shelter.	I have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.	Helping children abroad is on my bucket list.	Bucket lists are all well and good but sometimes we help out now.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I saw a disheartening bstory on the news about some children that were injured due to that very violence.	What do you think is the best solution or way to help for the average person like you or Me to render aid?	Save the Children works with government around the world to keep children from harm and abuse from crises situations by providing safe spaces for children to play, socialize, learn, and express themselves as they rebuild their lives.	Child Friendly Spaces also serve as a protective mechanism from abuse and psychosocial distress helping children both during and following crises.	So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?	When iIsaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iIshould not have ised that term, nor did I mean it lightly, I meant physically donating time and skills.	Volunteering and helping others with your time and effort is great, but in the meantime how can you help?	Donations let you help until you have the time and focus to knock those activities off your list.	St Jude's is another great organisation.	Well you can donate now to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I'm aware of how to donate and how easy it is.	You seem partial to save the children.	Do you have any personal connection with that charity?	I have worked with some charities in the past, Our Daily Bread for one, and I like the fact that Save the Children's focus is solely on the welfare of children.	They are a particularly vulnerable group and I find it reassuring that nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to their mission ??Â¸??Â¸ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe.	This percentage is adjusted each year end ??Â¸??Â¸ as of 2017, it is 86%.	The rest they for running their programs and raising funds to help more children.	I used to manage a store and we often picked childrens charities to give to.	It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate.	I think people fail to realize that without healthy, cared for, nurtured children, our future as a humanity becomes jeapodized.	Would you help out in this small way?	Your donation would be helping children really even a little bit helps so much.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I would be willing to donate the money from this task for sure.	I don't mean to repeat myself but how much would you like to donate to the charity now?	I woiwo be willing to donate $2	Great!	Thank you for helping...save the children.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Awesome.	Glad to know it will go to a child in need.
20180902-222227_892_live	hi there!	Hello.	How you doin	pretty good.	It looks like this chat is supposed to be to learn more about "Save the Children".	Have you ever heard of it?	Yes I am aware of that charity	It seems vaguely familiar but I never paid attention specifically.	Have you ever donated to them?	I have not but I have to some others recently	Do you feel that Save the Children is a good charity to give to?	From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause	I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?	It seems to be international, and supports children in developing countries.	It's apparently very influential in war zones like Syria	Oh wow that is good to know.	I know Syria is a mess recently	Absolutely.	It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there	Ugh that is rough..  Nobody deserves that in this world	I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.	As a mom myself, I'm thinking about donating my earnings from this task to them	That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?	From what I can tell, we can donate anywhere from 0 to $2 (the full payment).	Then through the official Save the Children website, I'm sure there's no max (and there'd be a tax deduction)	Ok good to know.	Thank you very much forthat info you have been very helpful!	I will donate all of $2 then :)	How often do you donate to things like this?	There are always things in my community that I attend and donate as much as I can and donate my time as well at the local Salvation Army.	I usually give to animal charities like the local no-kill shelter, but it's always interesting to learn about new places to make an impact.	Do you feel that you donate more in terms of money, or in terms of volunteering your time?	More money but I enjoy giving the time	I'm usually pretty busy so try to donate a little here and there.	Anyway, glad to meet you!	Have a great rest of your night!	Nice to meet you as well have a good one :)
20180904-032932_423_live	Hello.	Would you like to donate a portion of your reward to a charity called Save the Children?	I think I would be willing to donate a portion.	Excellent!	Would you like to know more about the charity first?	Yes, that was going to be my next question.	Save the Children promotes children's rights, and helps children from developing countries.	What types of children's rights?	Your donation would help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Many of these children live in developing or war-torn areas where these basic necessities are hard to come by.	What type of people or who manages this fund?	Save the Children has excellent credentials and is managed by a board of commercial CEOs and business leaders without any government or religious affiliation.	Does Save the Children help children in the United States?	Yes!	Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.	Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.	That is awesome.	I work hard to help children as well.	That's great!	It is a worthwhile cause and every penny has a significant impact on these children's lives.	Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.	I am curious why you chose the words "rural America"?	Of course.	I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.	Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.	mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.	I work with children more in an "urban" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.	I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts.	Admittedly, Save the Children may also have urban programs, but I drew the above information from their website, which you can find at  URL	Are you still interested in donating a portion of your reward?	I am interested.	I am curious if I can state if money goes to children in this country though?	Yes, you should be able to specify that.	The researchers will use this chat to determine how much of your reward to donate and will see that you have earmarked it for Save the Children's US efforts.	That is awesome then I will donate $1.	I feel very strongly about "our own children" !!	Excellent!	Thank you very much for your generous donation!
20180826-175426_937_live	Hello	hi	I would like to donate	definitely I like to help in anyway that I can to help children and animals.	Even it's 5 dollars	it depends.	I would like to donate about 0.50 to the charity	Yes me too	I feel that donating is an ethical reason to give your tithes and offerings	I like children	Me 2.	Children and Animals are the most precious of God's creations.	That's true also	I agree all the way that they are the best creations of all.	And giving a donation is an ethical choice.	Any amount I believe is good.	Yes I would donate	yeah me too.	I think 0.50 cents is a perfect amount to donate.	Did u donate before	Yes, But I donated about 0.20 cents.	This time I like to do 0.50 since I also know that the charity is legitimate.	Oh wow that's good	I always like to give a small donation of some kind and always believe that others should also.	Yes me too	I think it is also the right thing.
20180904-073734_888_live	Good morning.	Good morning, how are you doing?	I'm great, thank you for asking!	Do you have some time today to talk about an amazing charity I am part of?	Sure, I'd love to hear what charity you participate in	It's called Save the Children and we work towards helping disadvantaged children around the world have adequate food, shelter and healthcare.	Sounds wonderful!	Do you only work in the US?	Great question.	No, we work all around the world, wherever our help is needed.	What a great charity, is there anything I can do to help?	Absolutely, we are always looking for individuals who are willing to contribute to the cause.	How much are you looking for?	A donation of just $1 can help feed a child for 5 days.	And specifically, where does that money go towards?	The money goes towards providing meals and clean water.	I'd be interested in donating to your cause	That's great! Thank you very much for your donation!	Happy to be able to help such a worthy cause!	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	One last question - are all members who help volunteer based?	We do maintain support staff in country who are paid a living wage, but the rest of our staff are volunteers.	Great! Thanks so much and I'm just so happy to be able to donate
20180723-031022_254_live	Hello.	hi	I'd like to recommend a donation to Save the Children.	what exactly happened to these children's?	Save the Children supports many important childhood related causes, like helping to provide education and nutrition support to disadvantaged children.	I'd like to know what specific ethnicity are we supporting	Oh, I see.	There is no specific targeted ethnicity, the program uses funds to assist children in many different locations.	I see, can you go into a little bit more details about some of the childhood related causes ?	Sure.	A great example would be Save the Children's commitment to helping children suffering from disease.	During the 2014 ebola outbreak, funds were used to support hospitals in Sierra Leone to provide hospital beds and medical treatment for children suffering from the disease.	ah, I see, that's very heartbreaking to here.	I'd be glad to support the cause	That's great!	A very positive thing about Save the Children is that they are very good stewards of the donations they receive.	Almost 87% of all dollars donated go directly the programs supporting the children, so they have a very low overhead.	I'm glad to hear that.	Will I be getting any sort of reward as well?	Well, I suppose it depends on what you mean by a reward.	At the end of this chat, we'll both have an opportunity to donate a portion of our task payment to Save the Children.	You can choose any amount, from nothing to your full compensation.	I see, well, I'd love to do that then	That's great, it will be very much appreciated.	At the end of the task, the research team will collect the donations and send it to Save the Children.	awesome, thank you so much	How much do you think you'd like to donate to the charity?	I'd like to donate 5 dollar	That's wonderful, thank you so much!	your very welcome
20180902-220100_244_live	Hello! How are you?	Im very good how are you doing today?	I'm good thank you!	So according to this I'm supposed to tell you a bit about the Save the Children organization.	Have you heard of it before?	No i would be interested in learning	So I just looked it up and they do a lot of work for children around the world.	They do some work in and out of USA to give kids access to health care, education, and shelter.	Thats very beneficial.	Especially for third world country that have limited resources	Definitely!	They do a lot of work with emergency response stuff too which is pretty cool.	If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	Yes definitely.	It doesn't even take much.	A couple cents could really help these kids!	definitely.	The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	Oh yeah.	That and they're pretty transparent which is good.	It's not all given to the filthy rich CEO.	If we can get a group of Investors this organization can reach a larger spectrum	I've never even heard of it before today which is pretty sad.	Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention	Hmmm, I wonder if this is what that is?	Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence	That's so true!	So I guess now is the part where I ask if you'd like to donate any of your compensation to them?	Sure I like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others	Yay! How much would you like to donate?	I would love to donate $.50 cents	Sounds good, thank you!	Have a good night!
20180723-080158_200_live	Hey, how's it going?	Good, how are you?	Good here as well.	Do you have a moment to chat about children causes?	Sure thing.	What are they?	I'd like to talk about children who weren't born with the same as opportunities.	Particularly children who go hungry everyday and have no place to live.	How does that make you feel?	It sucks that not all people and children have the comfort of having a stable place to stay or the comfort of knowing they are able to eat.	It is sad.	What was life like for you growing up?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat or having a safe place to live?	I did not have to worry about those things.	Both of my parents were employed and were able to provide for me and my siblings.	I felt safe and secure in my home.	That is absolutely wonderful.	I feel many people take that for granted.	Not having to worry about those things while growing up.	It is not a problem just for children.	There are many homeless adults and adolescents that do not know where their next meal is coming from, or if it will ever arrive.	It would be great if we could work together to assure that everyone have at least those basic necessities met.	How do you suppose we do that?	We can't help everyone, but we can focus one cause at a time.	A cause that you believe in.	Have you ever of Save the Children?	I have not heard of Save the Children?	What do they do?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That sounds like a good organization.	I'm sure they do a lot of nice work.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0.50 to all your payment.	I am not willing to donate from my study payment as this money is vital to me.	I am sorry I am unable to help.	That is understandable.	Thank you for your time and information!
20180826-175706_443_live	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I have not.	What can you tell me about it?	It is an international non-governmental organisation.	It promotes children's rights	That sounds interesting.	I am all for helping children in any way possible.	Would you be interested in donating to this charity?	I would want to do some research first but that would be a possibility.	I like to learn as much as I can about an organization before donating.	Kids are dying from hunger every minute.	Don't you want to help stop that?	Of course I do.	I also want to make sure my donations are not going into the pockets of money hungry CEO's.	How do you feel about that?	I understand, but I can assure you that is goes directly to the kids.	How can you assure me?	Do you work for them?	I do not, but they are a very professional organization.	It is an international company.	Save the Children International's CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt earned $299,136 in 2017.	Simple Google search.	That isn't a lot for a CEO.	No its not.	However, that is only salary.	It doesnt include extras that all CEO's receive.	There isn't a lot of support for children in developing countries.	This should make you mad and want to help.	Have you personally donated?	Yes, why don't you join me?	That is impossible at this time.	I just do not have the funds available.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment."	I chose to donate $0.
20180826-065245_39_live	Hello there, how are you doing today?	I'm great, thanks.	How are you?	I'm doing swell, thanks for asking!	So how do you feel about children?	I love children.	I believe they are our future and should be taken care of in the best possible way.	That's great!	I happen to agree!	Do you have any children yourself, or do you plan to in the future?	I do not have children of my own and am not able to have them.	I am contemplating adoption for the future.	Oh, that's wonderful!	So many kids out there need a home, after all!	There are so many issues today with children, all over the world!	For instance, did you know that in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1k children were killed or injured in intensifying violence?	Wow, that is a staggering amount.	I did not know that.	I am a big fan of organizations who take care of the needs of hurt children.	Oh?	That\'s awesome!	I assume you\'ve heard about the organization called "Save the Children" then?	I have!	They seem to be doing a good job.	That, they do!	Did you know they've won over 7 different awards for their charitable work?	As a former foster kid, it makes me happy to see this place bring such awareness to the issues and needs of our young.	I am not surprised to hear that at all.	Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.	Absolutely!	In fact, you can even help!	If you want to make a small donation from your task payment, I'm sure it would be greatly appreciated!	You can donate just a few cents, or even the whole amount of your final payout if you choose!	I probably will do that.	If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.	Absolutely!	I mean, we already spend money on small snacks or a coffee we could forgo, why not give it to a charitable cause?	How noble of you!	I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.	Absolutely!	I remember being in a group home as a kid, and a bunch of ladies had made blankets and hats for us.	I still have the blanket I was made to this day!	A little goes a long way :)	Wow, that is so good to hear.	I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.	Kuddos to them!	Yeah, it really is humbling to watch society ban together and help each other!	Either way, I'm sure Save the Children will appreciate your donation, and be able to save many more children in the future.	You have a good day!	The life of a child is always worth saving.	You have a good day as well.
20180808-011341_389_live	Hello.	I have a story to share with you.	Of course im hear to listen .	I just donated to Save the Children and feel like it will be super helpful.	There was a child who died of hunger and I think my donation will help other children.	Yes i believe it most DEFINETLY will make a big impact on others lives and its amazing to see such kind hearted people like yourself do so.	Thanks!	I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily.	That means more than 9.1 million people die of hunger every year.	Yes its such a sad thing to see happen myself and family are very kind hearted and feel for all the people around the world who are suffering from this , And would love to make a change and to help .	Great to hear there are still kind hearted people to help people suffering!	It makes me angry to know of so many children in danger in the world.	Yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need !	Especially those who are very wealthy themselves and don't care to make a difference	I agree!	I certainly am not wealthy but still try to make donation as often as I can.	There are some wealthy people that are great philanthropists, but I think more people like you and I are needed to make even small donations.	Have you ever been to the Save the Children website?  URL	Yes most definitely i totally agree with you!	Yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children	You can make a donation from your incoming earning from this task to Save the Children.	Even just a small amount makes a difference?	I just realized I sound like a telemarketer!	Can you donate part of your payment?	I think we should.	As of right now i honestly would but i dont have the funds for it if their are other ways im albe to get others to donate as well and help out in any way possible i will be more then willing to do so..	Even just a small donation helps.	I will donate again if you match the amount of a snack!	Maybe .50 perhaps?	of course i could do so from my paypal	The research team will collect donations and send it to Save the Children.	So we don't even need to use Paypal.	oh okay then thats awsome to hear	Ok great!	I think we are really part of the solution this way.	Especially if that story of a child who died makes you angry like me.	It's so easy we won't even miss it.	Exacally if 50cents can make a differnce in someones like and i can help im all for it !!	(Inserts high five) My good deed for the day is done!	I try to do little things like this whenever I can.	In fact, I'm going to match your .50 and donate a $1.	wow how awsome it will really make a difference and i'm so happy we can both help to make a difference (double high five )	Thanks for agreeing to donate!	It was great talking to you and meeting someone who has a big heart like me :)	Thank you For being able to be so kind hearted as well hope u have a great day and keep a smile on your face ;)	It feels great	Most definitely does  and hope it will make someone else feel 10 times just as great	I am glad the Researchers are helping too!	Make it a great day!	Yes i didnt think that it would be this easy thats amazing	I have done it this way before and encourage you to do the same.	Skipping my candy bar today and feeling great!	yes i cant wait to be able to do more in the future yes it does feel good to know that will be going to a much better cause	(one last high five before I go) I'd love to chat with you more, but I have to run off --- my coffee is brewing and waiting for me to indulge.	Take care and keep doing good!	same thanks for the advice have a good one keep spreading love

20180808-011921_673_live	Hello how are you today?	Hi, I'm great, how are you?	I am fine, thank you, Have you ever heard about the organization "Save the Children"?	Yes, I have.	I am not extremely familiar with them, but I have seen several ads for them.	It is a big organization saving the children in almost 120 countries.	are you interested in donating?	Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity.	Do you have an amount in mind?	Not any specific amount, anything can be good, no matter small or big.	I usually donate to big organizations myself, and I have a soft heart for children	I do, too.	I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities.	From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.	Same here, Specially when i see how they are clear with their financial and how they try to help all children all around the world	I agree.	I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the money  is going to where they say it will.	I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.	Same here, It is also nice when I can donate anonymously.	It makes my heart happy how people know about these organization and they actually donate	I'm like you.	I always try to donate anonymously.	I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.	Same here, and I like how some HITs encourage us to donate.	I've been donating more since I've started working on MTurk.	That's funny that you mention that.	I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them.	I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered.	I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.	I donate most of my bonus when I can, I feel like it is free money and others deserve it more.	The good thing about it is when you want to donate on websites they usually have a minimum, but with HITs there is no minimum amount	Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	I know some of them get  really large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.	Exactly and they pay to workers good enough so they will be willing to donate.	It is worth a lot.	Specially when it is really trustworthy organization	Yes, and then most are willing to provide proof that they actually donated money, so that is good.	Yes, Thank you for time and attention, and thanks for helping.	Have a nice day!	Thank you so much, same to you!
20180825-064811_939_live	There is a very important charity called Save the Children.	Do you know much about it?	I do not, can you tell me some?	They help children all over who are in need.	They have programs to help with help, literacy, and disaster relief.	I would like to donate	How much of the money you earn from this task would you be willing to donate?	i would like to donate .05 cents	The research team will collect the donations and send it to Save the Children.

Did you know that 16,000 children under the age of 5 die each day?	wow no i did not	Most of them die from preventable diseases, too!	That horrifies me!	that is so sad do you work for the foundation?	No, but they've been around for a long time, and do a lot of good in the world.	Its so nice to see more poeple who care about them	They are only able to help when people donate.	that is so sad	Once again, thank you for your donation.	you are very welcome!

I am.	I tend to read news articles from aboard. BBC, ect.	I read that their are quite a few places that could use help.	Yes there are.	Have you ever heard of the organization Save the Children and are you aware of what they do?	I have heard of them, but have not looked into what they do.	Well they have a presence in every continent except Antarctica.	Domestically, they provide early education, literacy, and health and disaster preparedness programs.	That's very interesting, sounds like they do good work.	They are very renowned.	Internationally, they are pioneers in health education and protection programs.	They create long lasting results to save lives and the quality of those lives.	Do you know anyone that has worked for them?	I do not know anyone personally but but they are easily contacted through their website.	They are also involved in emergency response and global advocacy.	Sounds like they do a lot of good for a lot of people around the world.	Are you involved with them at all?	I am not personally but I would happily volunteer my time for this organization.	Have you ever donated to a charity?	I have.	I donate to my local charities, plus the United Way.	I am very glad to hear that.	Charity is very important and everyone should have a fighting chance in life.	Is this an organization you would consider donating to?	I might.	I wonder sometimes how much of the actual money that gets donated goes to helping people and not into the pockets of those running the charity.	86% of expenditures for this organization go directly to program services.	Well that seems better than some I have read about.	Have you ever donated to them?	I have in the past.	I believe they an amazing organization.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

Would $2.00 be too much to ask?	No, I can do it.	Thank you.	Can we make it $1.50?	These children really need the assistance.	$1.50 sounds good then.	Why not $1.75 then? :-)	I can do $2.00!	Happy to help.	Thank you so much!	Do you have any more questions for me?	Nope.	Thank you!
20180825-063117_677_live	How much would you like to donate to save the children?	Hey, is there a limit?	You can donate as much as you want	Oh wow, so I could just go ahead and do like $25 million?	If you have that much money	Oh, from my personal account?	Hmm, I can do maybe 100.	I work part-time and attend college so I don't have much now.	Thought this was hypothetical.	Then you will do 100	How much will you be planning on donating to the charity?	I am homeless and at Mcdonalds on the wifi.	I am doing this for charity.	But I plan on doing 10	That sounds good, thank you for being charitable.	Also, thank you.	This is for a good cause.	Promoting the right's of children that are suffering.	Yes, I feel like if anything could use more funding, it should be children who need extra assistance.	Would you be willing to make a pledge to donate at least 100 every month?	Hm, it depends on my schedule to be honest because I still have to pay rent and I don't have set hours but I'd be willing to give around $100 if I have solid hours every month.	It good to stand by your word and giving to the children.	And I thank you	You're welcome.	Do you know what these children are suffering from and what the money will be funding?	They are suffering from violence and starvation.	Your money will help to address these issues.	Wow, I can't even fathom feeling starved as a child or experiencing violence at a young age (outside of television/video games).	URL here is a link to the save the children website.	As a donor I wanted you to see the site and the children that you would be helping	Thank you for linking the website, I will check it out right now.
20180808-065307_529_live	Hello therehow are you?	I am good.	How are you?	I'm pretty good, just trying to get ready for work soon.	I understand that.	So tell me about this charity.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	They do work around health, education, etc.	I'm not sure that I have.	They work mostly in developing countries.	I would appreciate it if some of the funds could be donated.	The researchers will pass that donation on to the charity at the end.	What kind of work do they do?	They do emergency hunger relief, are engaged with Syrian children.	Ok, that sounds good.	How do I know it is a legitimate charity?	you can check their website  URL	They are highly rated by Charity Watch.	That's good to know.	How long have they been around?	Almost 100 years!	That's pretty impressive.	Do you think you would be willing to donate a portion of your earnings?	I just can't see doing that.	Why do you think that?	There are children dying in Syria who can benefit from the donation.	I understand that.	But, I choose my own charities independently.	ok, I understand that.	i hope you have a good day	Ok, you too!
20180723-034109_263_live	Hey	Hiya	are you familiar with Save the Children?	I'm not - Could you tell me more about it?	Well Save the children is an organization that ensures children rights to health education and safety.	Children who suffer from hunger would greatly appreciate a donation	Great - So how does the donation process work?	How do I make sure my money is being used for that purpose?	The research team will collect tall donations and send it to save the children	Ok - so can I donate $20?	Yes, your donation will be directly deducted from you task payment you can choose any amount from 0 to all of your paymen	oh - well since it'll be deducted from my task payment - Let's do half - $1	Half of 1 dollar?	Half the payment - One whole dollar	Alright thank you for contributing to Save the Children.	Your donation will help children who cant afford help and are living through hell on earth.	Great, so do we keep talking for like 4 more turns?	Yes i believe we have a couple more turns left so I'll educate you more on where your donation is going.	Did you know 5.6 million children die every year do to preventable and treatable causes?	I knew it was a large number, which is one of the things I was thinking Save the Children could help with	Luckily for them, Save the children not only excels in health care but they also help children to a classroom education, protect them from abuse, neglect, and lastly provides emergency care.	Huh, that's awesome.	Makes me feel even better about my donation	Do you usually donate to charities?	Yeah - I try to donate once a month or so	Alright, just to be sure you want to donate 1 dollar?	Yeah - That would be great.	Thank you so much!
20180808-075816_12_live	Have you heard of the Save the Children non profit organization?	Hello, yes I have but I am not sure what the charity works towards	It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ah ok very nice.	It sounds like a good charity.	Are you thinking of donating to it?	I am thinking about it.	I was hoping you would think about it too.	It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?	Yes, I definitely understand you.	It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country	I know it is crazy.	Sometimes I think about the little things I buy.	Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79.	Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.	Yes that is very true.	I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate.	I think it is the least I could do.	That is nice.	I try to do the same if I have the extra money.	Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though.	I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is.	Yes I understand.	I have been to third world countries in South America and seeing the living conditions of some people is very tough.	The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.	I have only been to Mexico and that was an eye opener.	One dollar is so valuable to them.	It is crazy!	Yes I know.	Any amount of money can help.	I think that we take many things for granted such as running water, and always having food on the table.	Right!	I think I am going to give a small portion of my hit payment to save the children.	Would you be willing to donate some of your hit money?	Yes, I would be willing to donate a small portion as well.	I think it would really help them out	That is great!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok, that's great.	I happy to help them.	Every month I always try to donate a little to charity	How much would you like to donate?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I would like to donate $.50	That is amazing!	Thank you so much.	I wonder how much 50 cents converts to for them.	It is probably at least like 5 dollars.	Thanks again!	Yes anything I can do to help.	I hope that it makes a difference!	have a good one!
20180827-041028_432_live	Good Morning!	How are you today?	Great!	How are you doing?	I am well.	What are your plans for the day?	i will be working all day.	Yes, I am getting ready for work as well.	Have you heard of the charity called Save the Children?	No I have not	It is a US based charity that helps kids by collecting money to help supply them with their basic needs like healthcare, food, and clothing.	Today I am asking if you would consider even a small donation to STC, even $0.05 would help.	Can the kids count on you?	$0.05?	that is not bad I could probably do that.	Thank you!	Everything really helps out.	Have you heard about the recent storms in Hawaii?	I kind of saw some stuff about them on the news.	Well, STC has already pledged to help the kids in Hawaii.	They do not waste any time and they get right to the world's problems.	I know I would feel horrible if any kids in my family/extended family were suffering.	Do you have kids in your family/extended family?	yes I have two a boy and a girl.	So you really understand kids!	I like this charity because they make it so easy to give any amount.	Were you interested in their website info?	yes that would be great i will take a look at it and tell you if i have decided to donate at this time or not	I already have you down for $0.05.	Were you willing to pledge more?	i will donate 0.10 today	That is fantastic!	They are US based, the US office is located in CT.	The site tells of all the areas getting help, including war torn areas as well.	It also details how people can sponsor individual kids.	It is a  great organization, don't you agree?	yes sounds great.	I agree, it really is.	It breaks my heart to know that while I have so much freedom there are kids that look at a simple meal as a lifesaving chance.	So I have you down for $0.10, right?	That is correct.
20180904-012448_306_live	Hello, I would like to speak to you about Save The Children .	Have you heard of this charity?	No, please tell me more.	Do they have a car?	I'm not sure if they have a car, but I am happy to tell you more about the foundation.	Efforts Focus on Restoring and Improving Early Learning and Education Programs, Helping Children Emotionally Heal, Building Resilience, Preparing for Next Emergency	How do they do that?	By people like you, making a a donation of just $1 a day, you can feed a child for a month.	The exchange rate must be pretty good.	How do they ensure that the money is effective in feeding the children and not lining pockets?	In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.	How do they define "Program services", and do they have independent verification of those findings?	They help to feed, house and educate children all around the world.	That really isn't an answer to the previous question, though	You can find reports associated with the financial information by visiting this link:  URL s/about-us/resource-library	That is a solid informational link, including a full board of trustees to look into.	What about controveries in 2009 regarding parents in Britain?	I believe this is still under investigation.	Should have went for deflection or dismissal.	Works better on skeptics.	Ditto for their problems with the energy company in 2013.	Although that one is easier to spin as seeking more money to fund more projects.	You could also mention their rating from the BBB.	So are you willing to donate 10 cents today, this money can go to helping children who have grown up with the threat of violence and starvation all of their lives.	I'll donate 10 cents.	Cool thank you.	Together, we're changing children's lives and the future we all share.	I'm not certain if that's scripted or not but if it isn't there's a better way to word that and if it is I think the person who wrote it might need to retire because they clearly come from the 50s.	You should feel proud of the decision you have made today.	Now you're just messing with me intentionally.
20180825-065106_23_live	Hello?	Hello.	I hope you are well.	Same, would you like to donate to Save the children?	I think it is very important to help children that are less fortunate.	Tell me more about "Save the children."	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It would do a great help with your donation.	What service does this charity provide?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I like the sound of that.	Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?	he money goes to the charity as a whole not to a particular kid, so when you donate you know you helping more than one child.	That makes sense and I do like the money to be spread to everyone.	Is this primarily in African and South America?	Yes, as well as other places also...	How much would you like to donate?	How do we know that our donation is reaching those in need?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation would be a small part in keeping the children safe from the violence.	I hope that is the case as I hate to read about children in danger.	Is this donation a one-time thing?	Yes, this donation is a one time thing.	But if you like to continue donating your welcome to do so, how much would you like to donate?	I think I could donate $5.00.	Ok, $5 is a great amount make sure when its time to donate you deliver and the children will be proud.	Thank you	You are welcome; anything for the children I say!	Your a great person and thanks again, have a nice day.	I hope you have a great day as well!
20180723-042226_724_live	Hi there.	How are you today?	Hello, I am fine, how about you?	Very well thanks.	Do you currently give any money to charity on a regular basis?	Yes, I try to help time to time	Any charity in particular?	No, anything that catches my eyes, or I find them on gofundme, what about you?	I have a few payments set up monthly.	I assume then you've heard of Save the Children and the great work they do with young people?	Yes, I've heard of it.	Can you please explain more about it?	Firstly, they provide funds and support services to help protect vulnerable children all over the world.	Once the children have a safe environment the next priority is to improve their lives via education and other resources.	They really make a difference to the lives of children in poverty or destitution.	I am interested in it.	I already checked their website.	Health and education both are important factors	Absolutely.	And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate!	We're asking people today to give a small part of the payment for this HIT to the charity.	You'll get a box pop up at teh end of our chat which will give you the opportunity to donate something.	Obviously the more the better, but I also appreciate that you aren't turking for free so you can judge it yourself.	Actually I like these kind of HITs.	I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward.	I happily did.	I am sure there are people who need it more than me	You're absolutely right-  sometimes we don't realise it, but what seems like a little bit of moeny to us can make a big difference to them.	I worked in Africa earlier this year and the difference a few dollars can make to people over there is unbelievable.	Yes, few dollars can save a child or can help a family to survive for a month.	How long have you worked there?	I'm back in the UK now - I was in South Africa (Durban for three months from January to end of March) for work.	That is so nice of you.	It is a big thing to do.	Thinking about starving children makes me so sad.	I wish I could do more	We can all do something - donate a little bit or volunteer to try to help.	There are lots of opportunities	Yes you are right, I help as much as I can.	at least I try.	save the children sounds like an amazing organization.	They work in 120 countries already	They certainly do and they are well established so you cna be certain they are going to use the money in a good way.	Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt.	I already read few of their reports on their website.	I wish they can help even more countries	Me too.	When we click done that donation box will appear - it should be pretty self-explanatory.	I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.	Thanks again.	Thank you, I will do it for sure, have a nice day
20180808-032545_201_live	HI GOOD MORNING	Good morning.	How are you today?	FINE,SAVE THE CHILDREN , HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DONATION THE SAVE THE CHILD.	I don't usually donate to charities.	Is that something that you personally do?	NO BUT, ITS A INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION TO THE CHILD	I like the fact that it's an international organization.	What kinds of things do children's charities do?	SAVE THE CHILDREN , FOR YOUR CLARIFICATION YOU GO AND CHECK THE  URL WEBSITE.	ITS VERY HELPFUL TO THE ORGANIZATION.	I took a look at the website.	So it looks like the money goes toward health and education?	Things like that?	YES, SO HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE TO DONATE TO THE CHARITY NOW?	I'm still not sure.	I worry that my money won't actually go to the children, that it'll just be paying for someone's job at the charity.	YOU CAN TRUST OUR  ORGANIZATION, YOU DONATE THE CHILDREN IS VERY HELPFUL TO THEY OF EDUCATION , HEALTH AND SAFETY. ETC.,	Do you know how much of the donation goes to the children?	I heard that, with some organizations, only 10% of the money goes to the recipient!	NO, WE CAN PUT 100% TO THE CHILDREN USE ONLY, SO YOU CAN TRUST OUR ORGANIZATION.	That makes me feel much better.	Does your organization provide receipts, for tax purposes?	NO TAX AND HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE TO DONATE TO THE CHARITY NOW?	How does a person go about making a donation?	On the website?	URL YOU GO AND DONATE TO THE WEBSITE.	What kind of payments do you take?	Do you take credit cards?	YES SURE,	I think that you convinced me.	I'll definitely go and make a donation today.
20180825-042845_49_live	Hello, are you interested in protection of rights of children?	Yes, definitely.	What do you have in mind?	There is organisation called Save the Children and donations are essential to ensure children's rights to health,education and safety.	Is this the same group where people used to "sponsor" a child?	Here is their website, URL	They help children all around the world.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I can't imagine how terrible it must be for a child to grow up inside a war zone.	As you mentioned,this organisation has different programs,and one of them is to "sponsor" child.	You choose the location.	Are you connected with the NGO yourself?	No,but i want to donate some amount from this survey.	Research team will send money to this organisation.	That sounds great.	Does it come from our reward/bonuses?	Yes,the amount you want to donate is deducted from your reward.	What do you have in mind?	I know that my small donation is not enough,so i am asking you to also donate some small percentage from reward.	I am willing to match your donation.	Cool,the reward for this task is 0.30$ so i am  thinking about donating like 0.15$	That's fine with me.	I could even go for the whole $.30 if you want.	Well, if you go for full 0.30 i will have no moral right to donate less.	That is kind of you.	My husband and I have a small NGO in Mindanao, Philippines, and it is amazing what a little bit of money can do to make things better.	Agree,small amount of money for US can mean a lot for people in third world countries.	So agreed?	We donate full reward each??	Yes, let's donate $0.30 each.	That's a whole lot of rice and flour.	Or a whole lot of bandages.
20180825-044358_663_live	Hello, I would like to ask you to consider making a donation to Save the Children, an international NGO committed to promoting children's rights, and providing support for children in developing countries.	ohh how much donation would yoy expect?	Your donation can be from $0 to all of the payment for this task.	But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does.	There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.	So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world.	how do i trust the organiation?	Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background.	You can read about their successes on their website:   URL	Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs.	okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?	I donated $2, which is the maximum payment.	I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.	okay i will donate $1	If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more.	After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.	Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.	no i am okay with this amount	OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.	I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.	actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly	While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children.	Save the Children maximizes the efficiency of donations so that every dollar makes a difference.	Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?	yes i am very much sure.	as of now i am donating $1	Well, we at Save the Children would like to thank you for your donation and let you know that thanks to donors like you, children around the world are thankful	thank you.	anything else?	Yes, if you would like more information about programs we accomplish, or to receive our newsletter, we can put you on our mailing list.	It will allow you to stay up to date on programs we accomplish daily	okay done.. thanks	Thanks very much for your time.	Have a wonderful day!	same to you :)

20180826-052222_969_live	hello	Hi, how are you?	I'm doing great, I hope all is well.	Thanks.	We're here to talk about a children's charity, is that right?	T hat is correct, I hope you are interested in donating today.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	What is the charity?	Save the Children, it is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I've heard of them.	It's a good charity.	It is I have personally been involved with this charity after finding out that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence	The violence in Syria is one of the saddest things happening in the world today, as far as I know.	I heard a really heartbreaking interview with a Syrian child who lost his dad on NPR the other day.	My husband had family in syria when the attacks where happening and I can tell you that not being able to do anything was the worst feeling in the world, but knowing that charities like save the children exist was a relief	I'm really sorry.	Does Save the Children help find a place for refugees?	yes Save the Children does in fact help find places for refugees, if you would like more info you can visit  URL s/what-we-do/emergency-response/refugee-children-crisis	Thanks.

Good luck to you
20180719-120436_413_live	Hi there	Hello	Have you heard of the Save the Children charity?	I actually have not.	What do they do to help children?	It is an international organization that helps protect and promote rights for childrens and provides for them in suffering conditions - such as lack of basic needs, like water, clothing, and food.	I'm glad a charity like that exists internationally.	It's for a great cause.	Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today.	Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit.	Even little bits can go a long way, you know?	it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.	Absolutely.	I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in.	I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs.	It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.	Exactly.	It's not like we really get the choice of how/when/where we are born.	It's a matter of chance.	It's unfair to be born into conditions like that.	Hopefully, more the people born more lucky can lend a hand.	Absolutely!	Would you like to be able to assist some of these children by donating any amount of your choosing up to $2?	A little bit can go a long way!	Yes, absolutely.	I can donate $0.50.	The charity will greatly appreciate your contribution I'm sure!	Are you absolutely sure you'd like to donate $0.50?	Yes, I am sure.	Okay, the charity will greatly benefit from your help!	If you'd like to donate a few more cents, that would help even more children get out of poverty and live a much more clearer life.	I understand.	Unfortunately, I have to take care of my kids, too, and can't afford to help more.	I absolutely understand.	Thank you for taking the time to help assist the charity and I hope that you have a wonderful day!	I hope you do as well!
20180904-025026_901_live	Hello.	How are you today?	If you have the time, I would like to talk with you about a charity.	I am well today thank you.	I would be happy to listen.	Thank you.	Do you know the organization Save the Children?	I do not.	What do they do?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	They work for children's rights, helps support children in developing countries.	That sounds like a great cause.	It really is.	They work so the chieldren can have access to health, education, safety.	In developing countries like Syria, millions of children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I feel very bad for the children in Syria.	I can't imagine what they are going through.	Helping them is very important as is helping our children here.	I agree.	And sometimes even a small help is a lot, thinking many others will do the same.	I agree with that.	Does this organization spend the majority of their donations on the cause or are the higher ups lining their pockets?	Ah, a rightful question.	This really is a trustworthy organization and they do work for the children.	Actually, you can get more information about the organization from their website:  URL	The website says that 86% of funds go to the cause.	That's a really good number considering the overhead that must be required for international relief.	You are right.	This is a trustable fund.	Would you care to donate a little bit for the children?	What are my options for donation?	How can I donate and how much?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Thank you.	I would like to donate $0.30 today.	Thank you very much!	The children from around the world will surely be thankful as well.	You are very welcome.	Thank you for telling me about this organization.	Have a great day!	You as well.

20180826-061500_476_live	Hi would you be willing to donate to Save the Children?	I'm not sure, what do they do for children?	They help support children in warzones  and it helps provide them with things they need	sounds like a good charity.	It is a good charity and any little bit will help	I would consider it.	What about Big Brother, Big Sister, they are very much in need of donations	They are good also but right now this is the organization that needs it most.	What about helping children who are living in poverty in America.	There are thousands that need help	There are lots of children in need but this will help children with medical and emotional support in war areas.	Good point, I think I may consider it	Also it will give them food and healthcare they need to survive	how much of the donation would actually go to the kids>	Whatever amount you donate will go directly to the kids.	I'm thinking about whether this is better than other charities I give to	I think it is a great charity because it helps children who are separated from their families	Perhaps people could go and help in person, rather than donating money?	Well most of their work is in poor countries but I am sure that you can do both	How much is a good donation?	Any amount would help.	They accept donations of any size.	Okay, I will make a donation for $10.	You convinced me that it's a worthwhile charity.	That is a great choice.

20180808-064212_144_live	I would like to encourage you do donate a part of your earnings for this HIT to a charity called Save the Children	What does Save the Children do?	For one, they are committed to providing health and nutrition programs that save children's lives and ensure they grow up healthy.	It is worldwide or one specific country?	They serve children worldwide	I like the sound of their work, but I'm always suspicious about how much of a donation reaches the people in need.

I donate a portion of each of my paychecks to them automatically	That is impressive.	How long have you been doing that?	For the past 3 or 4 years	I am considering a donation.	Even small donations go a long way	I wish there was a long-term solution to these problems.	We all do, but for now, there are children in need and this organization does amazing work	I am thinking of 50 cents.	That's 25% of the HIT.

I've checked on this link:  URL s/about-us/financial-information	thanks.	i wonder what a reasonable donation amount would be.	on the website there is a minimum amount but through HIT you can donate anything even 1 cent.	I donated before and surprisingly it did not even hurt my reward.	I thought it will	Great.	Then I will do it.	I usually donate to animal charities.	I love animals.	MTurk introduced me some good charities.	I donated 50 cents each time to "Save the Children"	Good to know.	Thanks for the info, guess I am skeptical.

I believe every child deserves the chance to have food in their bellies and an education to be able to help others when they get to adulthood.	This is so true.	The reason I ask is because I have cared for abused and neglected children and see the results and how it effects them for the rest of their lives.	Yes, I sure hope we are able to raise a lot of money for this very worthy cause.	I am very curious to how the decision is made and what type of medical care they plan to deliver.

They promote children's rights and provide much needed relief.	in my church we help people no matter their age, but children are special for us	The donation would be 100% tax deductible too	That's right, how do you help children?

20180717-200206_41_live	Hey, how are you doing, have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?	No I havent.	What is it about?	It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries, does that sound like something you'd get behind?	No thank you.	May I ask why?	Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?	I am already making a difference in many children lives.	That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children?	I have donated 15 years of my life to charity	I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?	No thank you	You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?	No thank you	Do you have children yourself?	What if your children were in a position these kids are in, wouldn't you want someone to help them?	Where are those childrens parent?	If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.	My small change won't do a thing for those kids.	What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25	Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge.	I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference	You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to	What do you say?	If it makes you happy, go ahead and take .50	Oh thank you so much, you have no idea how much that .50 will mean to those children, thank you very much and have a wonderful night you blessed soul.	No problem have a good night

They do great things for children with cancer/diseases.	Would you consider donating to them instead.	I really have my heart on the Save the Children and the fact that it can be done right from the task makes it so much easier	That may be true, but I do like Riley Children's hospital as it is local to my area.	The Save the Children helps people all over the world including here in Amercian	Yes, but I like to see where my money is going to help.	I think we need to help those here first.	There is so much poverty and sickness here.	Yes, there is.	And I understand wanting to see it done local.	The Save the Children is on stand by to help the children of Hawaii right now for the Hurricane Lane	I might reconsider donating then.	You can donate anywhere from $0 to all of your task payment today.	I might be able to manage a little today.	That is awesome.	How much would you like to donate today?	I can't manage much as I am short on cash	If you donate right now from your task payment then you are donating money that you don't even have yet.	This is true.	Ok, since it's the hurricane victims.

20180825-045559_409_live	Hello!	Hi!	Would you consider yourself a giving person?	Yes, I think that would be accurate.	Do you like Children?	Yes, I do.	How would you feel about donating your payment for this survey to a charity that saves children, aptly named "save the children"?	I would consider it.	awesome, since it is not a huge payment, low risk, great social reward :)	I would need to know more about the charity first.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries	How many children do they help annually?	Let me get you that information!	I also have a link to their website here for your convenience:  URL	I'll check out that website later.	Awesome, though sadly they don't have ready information on how many children they help annually, the organization is transparent about where their funding goes, and they do allocate a majority of their funds (9 out of 10 dollars) to their needs programs.	If you are a US citizen, Save the Children also has US initatives including emergency funds, advocacy programs, and education, among others	They sound like they are a legitimate organization.	Yes!	After our conversation, I will be donating as well, as their initiatives align with my own beliefs as well :)	I don't think I'm quite ready to decide yet though.	What would help you decide?	Just need to investigate them a little more.
20180826-184708_183_live	hello?	Hello there!	Would you like to donate to Save the Children?	Yes, what would this charity be doing to save the children?	Save the Children is and how their donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	What have they done in the past?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	What countries have they been able to help?	Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I am aware of the violence in Syria but what has "Save the Children" done to aid in health, education and safety?	Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families.	How much would you like to donate?	Before I can donate I will need to know how this organization has help.	Be specific in what your asking?	How has "Save the Children" helped to aid in health, education and safety of the Syrian children?	Save the children send over rights to health, education, and safety with the funds that you donate to developing countries Syria was an example of countries we aid with the donation.	Would you like to donate?	Send over rights?	I do not understand.	I also agreed to donate but before that I need more information, why do you keep asking me to donate?	Because you keep asking the same question for someone that conversing about donating to a charity.	Its almost like you want to see paper work proof, I told you where your donation goes either you want to donate or not?	Exactly, in today\'s world one must be weary of scammers.	Those who are really trying to do "good" for others will be more than happy to show proof of where donations are going or at least letting one know how those donations will be put to use.	Telling me where it goes really does nothing for me.	URL go check it out.	Why the aggressive tone of me "donating or not"?
20180826-174933_275_live	hi how are you today?	I am well, how are you?	I am good do you have any children?	Yes, I have two.	And you?	I have two also but mine are grown and gone now	That's nice.	How old are they?	32 and 29 a boy and a girl and 4 grand kids 3 girls and 1 boy ages 6 to 14.	Unfortunately they all live far away.	And you?	Oh my!	That's nice.	My kids are 4 and 7.	Boy and girl.	That was a hectic but really fun time for me and my kids.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I have not.	What is the charity and what do they do?	I am not an expert but I believe they help children in war torn areas to get to safety and make food and medical supplies available	That seems like a really noble cause.	I have an affinity for children.	I donate a lot of money to battered wives and their children.	I spend a lot of time in the shelter for them too.	Seems like a great cause!	Would you be willing to donate something to this cause?	With the commitment I made to the shelter, I would not donate at this time.	I can understand that I donate regularly to St Judes Childrens hospital myself. I appreciate your commitment to your cause and it is an important one.	Thank you for your recognition.	St Judes is such a great cause too.	I have donated a few times to them too.	Yours is so much more hands on and personal i really admire your dedication because you also donate your time and yourself and it sets a good example for your children to Kudos to you.	Thank you.	do you do any volunteer work?	Not officially I am kind of the one that even strangers come up to and talk to when something is going wrong in their life and I try to encourage and comfort them and point them to a helping hand if I know of one.	Like a shelter or a free counseling place or a food bank.	That serves a purpose too!	I work with my local goverment in policy development and people like you really make a great impression on the policy that is created.	Great job!
20180903-103835_253_live	Hello there, how are you?	Hi	How much do you know about Save the Children?	I know that it is a charity.	I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.	Were you aware that Save the Children assists both children in the U.S. as well as foreign countries?	No.	I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.	That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!	I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.	Yes, not only do we help out with literacy and school related causes, but also with feeding, shelter, and disaster relief for children all over the world.	That's wonderful!	Are you a top rated charity?	How much goes to administrative costs?	We are a top rated charity, and have been around for nearly 100 years!	Nearly 90% of our funds go straight to children, with the remainder going to fundraising costs and only 5% for admin costs.	Wow!  That's really great!	I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	I think this is a fair percentage to have.	We try our best to keep the children first, and have done so in aiding millions of children over the years.	I think that's great!	What country is in the most need right now?	Both Africa and USA currently have the highest number of children in need.	That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	It is very sad, but with the help of so many millions of caring people we are able to enrich the lives of so many.	What is the money used for mostly?  Food?  Toys?  Clothes?	I think this is all very interesting stuff.	I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.	Monies go to sustain the lives of children in environments in which basic necessities are lacking.	For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That's terrible.	I hope this kind of environment changes for them.	Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.	Well, each day children are able to get such needs met by the generosity of those even with donations as small as the cost of about $1 a day.	A little goes such a long way!	I can imagine!	I hope lots of people donate to you.	I bet it's especially good around Christmas when people are in the spirit of giving.
20180903-094545_472_live	Hello how are you today?	I'm good.	How are you?	I am doing great!	I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.	Please tell me more.	These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.	All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children.	How do I know this charity is legit?	You are free to look up any information you like at  URL	How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?	100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children.	Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.	Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?	The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children.	So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children	What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children.	Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	They need your help.	They need your donation more than you do honestly.	What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?	There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.	I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.	You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam.	Can I count on you to help these children?	Are you willing to trust me enough to donate your task payment to help these children?	I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam.	I have been scammed before.	That is why i am asking you for the details.	Againwhat  roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?	I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers.	86.5% of donations goes directly to the villages and the rest goes to fund the outreach, website, and publicity. it is a non-profit organization. You don't have to donate the entire amount of your task payment. you can choose any amount from nothing to the $2. I am just hoping you would be gracious to help these children enough to give the $2 and give them a fighting chance. I really believe you know this isn't a scam	How do you donate?	This chat is being recorded, you Tell me how much you would like to donate and I will give it to the research team for them to deduct it from your task payment and send it to Save the Children.	How much would you like to donate today?	I am still not 100% confident this isn't a scam as it is all done via the computer and not face to face.	Would you like to take a few minutes to go over the website first before you commit?
20180825-100043_534_live	Helli	Hello	Will you donate a portion of your wages to save thw childern	I would be willing to donate a portion of my wages	Great it will be taken straight from the payment	I am thinking I only want to donate .10	Thats fine	What childrens charity is this?	Save the children are you aware of what thwy do	I am somewhat familiar with them	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That is so heartbreaking.	Save the children sounds like a wonderful charity to donate to	Yes its wonderful they help displaced kids	Do they find family's for the children or are they running a orphanage?	Save the Children is and how their donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	It's so important that there is a organization looking out for children.	I only hope that the money goes directly to children programs instead of being eaten up by overhead costs	Yes more than likely it will	So you dont actually know how they use the koney?	Yes it goes straighr to the save the children	money?	Am so glad to hear that	Do how much are you donating	Do how much are you donating
20180825-112434_860_live	Have you heard of the charity Save the Children?	No, I don't believe I have.	What are their goals?	They give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave.	They do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we all share.	That sounds like an amazing charity.	That is something I could really get behind.	It's a great charity that has helped more than 155 million children in 120 countries.	Do you ever donate to charity?	Yeah, I donate here and there.	If I'm in the right place at the right time or am given an opportunity.	Save the Children is a wonderful charity to donate to.	86% of money raised goes directly to the children.	Would you be interested in donating to Save the Children?	Where does the other percentage of donations go?	I would possibly be interested!	9% goes to fundraising and 5% goes to management and general expenses.	Please ask any questions you may have.	I want you to feel comfortable knowing your donation is really going to help children.	What areas of the world do they cover?	Is it an international charity, or exclusive to the US or another country?	The charity helps children in the US and worldwide.	Africa, Asia, and the US are the top regions receiving aid from Save the Children.	Your donation goes a long way too!	What is the average donation amount that most donors contribute at one time?	I don't have that information at hand, but even .30 cents goes a long way!	Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this HIT to help children eat and go to school?	I would be willing to at least donate a portion of my earnings to help this charity.	That's wonderful, thank you!	You know 30 cents may not seem like a lot to you, but to a child who is hungry and sick, it can mean the difference between life and death.	Are you sure you wouldn't want to help a child by donating the full amount?	I could do that.	30 cents for the children is okay with me!	Thank you!	Your donation is going to help a child eat, receive an education, and have access to life-saving medicine.	Who knew 30 cents could do so much!?	Do you have any other questions?	I don't think so.	Thank you for taking the time to introduce me to this charity!	Do I need to do anything else to make sure I get the money donated?	Nope, it will all be handled on my end.	On behalf of children worldwide, thank you for your kindness.	155 million children benefited last year, with your help we'll reach even more!	Thank you!
20180808-022730_384_live	Hello how are you?	Hey, I am doing well	I have a friend of mine in another country who lost a child today to hunger	That is terrible.	Are there any charities that work in that area?	Yeah.	It's really sad we have the money to just splurge on stuff in our normal every day lives but we can't spend just a few bucks a month or year for the children!	It hurts my heart when I see those children's charity commercials.	Yeah I know.	What do you think we can do?	Donate some money maybe?	30 dollars a month can change a child's life	Yeah I know this great charity called Save the Children that takes money for this exact type of issue.	We should donate to them!	I know!	What a worthwhile cause!	They also have a website  URL if you would like to look it up and make sure it's a legit organization	Yeah, I have used Gospel for Asia in the past	I think we should use Save the Children this time for a more global effort though	It feels good to make a difference if only for one child	This is true.	I think I'm going to donate about $2.00 right now!	It's weighing heavy on my heart.	That is freat!!	Good for you!	Do you want to donate some too?	I may donate something!!	You could donate anywhere from 0 to 2.00 if you want!	How much do you want to donate?	I am not sure	Just think.	$2 you won't miss.	At all!	And it could seriously help several children in countries that don't have it.	Whaddya say?
20180826-054232_684_live	Hi!	Are you interested in making a donation to Save the Children?	Hi, Yes I am	That's great to hear!	Donations make a huge difference in the lives of these kids.	Your help will give them access to food, healthcare, education, and safety, among other things.	Yes, I agree.	Helping children and pets is one of the donations I enjoy making and helping at the same time.	Do you have an amount in mind that you'd like to donate?	I was thinking to donate around 10 cents for save the children.	I hope that is adequate and helps them for food and shelter.	Any amount we can collect for them is welcome.	Would it convince you to donate more if I can assure you that the donation is absolutely secure and will be completely given to a trustworthy, verified fund within Save the Children?	ok how about 20 cents.	I do want to help in anyway that I can.	Thank you so much.	It's really appreciated.	The amount of suffering that children around the world face is terrible.	For example, in the first two months of 2018, a thousand children in Syria were injured in the violence there.	Anything you can add to the donation will go directly to helping them.	yeah I heard a little bit about on how children are suffering.	I want to give a donation to help them.	I am glad I can help in anyway that I can.	It will make a big difference to Save the Children.	The organization has done wonders for kids, saving them from everything from violence to starvation.	We as people have a moral responsibility to help them, and when we have extra, there's no better place to put it than in the hands of a trustworthy charity that will use it to save kids.	Yes, I believe it is good to be ethical.	And to help children and animals as much as we can.	Most of all save the children is a trustworthy organization which I trust to put my donations in with.	To confirm, you said you were willing to donate 20 cents, correct?	Yes that is correct	Is there anything you'd like to ask, or any way I can convince you to send a little more to Save the Children in the interests of the kids they work to help?	I feel that 20 cents is adequate for the donation.	I want to help in any way that I can.	Also I want to verify that this organization is most trusting.	Alright, 20 cents out of the whole task payment amount.	Thank you again for the donation.	It will be sent to Save the Children.	thank you.	I wanted to help and want to help with a donation	It's much appreciated.	what hobbies do you like?	and where are you from?
20180825-075844_569_live	Have you ever heard of the charity children?	I don't think so, what do they support?	I'm sorry.	It's save the children.	My fingers don't type very well.	It's an international nongovernmental organization.	They are looking out for children's rights in developing countries	Oh, yes.	I do know save the children.	They are a great organization.	That's great news, you know they are untrustworthy.	Have you ever donated to them?	I haven't donated to them, which is good apparently.	What makes them untrustworthy?	Oh my goodness I meant to say trustworthy.	ha, that is much better.	I don't have a lot of income to donate to charity :(	I don't either, and when I do I usually donate to dog charities.	LOL but after reading up on this they said every penny helps.	I think I could spare .25.	Do you want to kick in a little?	I donate to a dog charity also!	such sweet creatures.	I have a dachsund/pit mix named Tuttle.	I can spare a quarter if it helps.	That's why we don't have extra money.	LOL I have a Labrador who eats everything and this shepherd beagle mix.	They are my children .	But I guess once in a while we should donate to real children LOL .	Okay cool I'll donate 1/4 and you donate 1/4 and then we've done our good deed for the day!!!!	Sounds good to me.	We could donate our earnings from this hit and still make a nickel for kibble.	Lmao!	Deal!!!	Have a great day from Illinois!	Thanks, warmest regards from Alabama	I guess we have to each have 10 turns so after this response we have to write two more times LOL	I was wondering that.	Are you a cubs fan?	Not really but I've been to one of their games.	It was fun.	Are you?	I don't really have a team, but I like baseball.	What are your dogs names?	Clementine and Eddybear.	And they are tired of me messing around on the computer so after the survey we are going to go for a walk!!	I think we took ten turns!	Enjoy they walk, I hope it isn't too hot like here.	we have to walk early and late.	It's really hot here too.	Okay I'll put it in my quarter if you put in yours and have an awesome day!	It's really hot here too.	Okay I'll put it in my quarter if you put in yours and have an awesome day!!
20180723-121545_265_live	Hey!	Hi there, how's it going?	So I wanted to explain a little about the Save the Children foundation, and why donating is important..	It's a non governmental program that promotes the rights of children, and provides relief to these children in developing countries	They sound like an interesting charity.	How do they go about providing relief to the children?	Well, they provide education, food, and clothing.	Also, when a child is sick, they sometimes don't have the funds for proper healthcare, so unfortunately they die.	It's really terrible.	So many children die from hunger, and it's not fair.	Why are you passionate about this particular one?	There are so many charities that claim to do the same things.	It is the worlds first global charity for children, and have credentials to back them up.	Charity watch group gives them the top rating for achieving results.	The money is truly going to the children, as opposed to the company	You sound very passionate about them.	Ok. I'll believe you.	That's so great.	So will you donate a little of your earnings towards this charity?	I may be interested.	What are the amounts to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from 0 to all of your payment.	I wouldn't suggest all of your payment, but just a small amount would help	I will donate $0.25	That would be so great.	You are extremely generous	I admire your effort reaching to people to help the charity.	Yeah, I think helping Children is the most important charity there could be.	Unfortunately, there are way too many scam companies out there	I'm glad you understand my concern about scams.	By the way, what is their site?	URL  you can go there to find more information	I definitely will check it out.	Thank you for the information.	You're welcome!	Thank you for the donation	What was life like for you growing up?	Is there a reason children in particular are so special to you?	I am a teacher, so I have a lot of compassion
20180826-175233_4_live	Hi!	How are you today?	I'm great.	How about yourself?	I'm doing great, thanks.	Do you donate at all?	I do donate sometimes, yes.	that's great, have you ever donated to save the children?	I have donated a couple of times; like for the St Jude's Hospital, red nose day and March of Dimes.	I do what I can to give back.	That is really great.	I know how hard it can be to give, but it's amazing how a small amount can make such a big difference	That is very true.	If more people gave, even it's a small amount, it truly adds up and can make a difference.	You are very right.	And the children are the ones who need it the most!	Absolutely, they are the future generation and it's imperative that they are nurtured and looked after.	I completely agree!	And save the children really focuses on ensuring the children get the money that is donated	That's great.	Could you tell me more about this charity?	It is an organization that helps children from all over the world, such as the millilns of syrian children living through war	Sounds amazing.	How are the proceeds distributed?	they are credible and ensure the money they get goes to the children	How would you go about donating to this cause?	You can go to the website  URL	Awesome, I'll head over there right now and support it thank you.	great!	how much do you want to donate today?	I can donate a dollar for now since I don't have much right but I feel obligated to at least donate something.
20180826-073858_133_live	Hi, how are you today?	Great what about you?	Do you donate to children's charities often?	Not bad, I donate all the time specifically to Save The Children, they are a great charity because 100% of the money donated is given to those children who need it most how about you?	I have donated to them in the past.	Do you donate through MTurk only?	Well, today all donations are directlt deducted from the Mturk task payment so would you be interested in donating today?	I would, I usually donate some portion of my winnings when it's a children's charity.	They are the most vulnerable in society.	Oh, I know children did not ask to grow up in these coditions adults have let them down in so many ways	I know, it's also so sad the the more nutricious foods are always the most expensive.	I donate to the NYC Food bank also.	They help a lot of city kids.	That's another great cause	How much to you plan on donating today considering that we may get a bonus?	Normally I donate about $1.00 how about you?	I usually donate like I would in real life...	like a quarter here and a quarter there.	well, every cent counts that's what I say or a penny saved is a penny earned either way it works out the same	Yes, and it all adds up at the end of the month especially when you're also struggling to make ends meet.	oh, yes definately, so do I have your commitment to a donation today?	Definitely, I will donate my $0.30.	What about you?	yes, I was going to as soon as I saw the charity it was going to such a great cause	Oh, mine just says "children\'s charity" but does not mention any specifics.	Either way its cool.	I'm pretty sure its Save the Children because it says it on my side	Nope, mine doesn't maybe that was the point, to see if I would donate to just any charity. Still I always hope the money actually gets to them.	It will through the researchers they promised

20180826-013036_595_live	Hi, would you like to donate to Save the Children?	hello, I have heard of the organization but I am unfamiliar with what they do.	what would my donation go toward?	Your donation would help promote children's rights help support children in developing countries.	It can really make a difference.	I think I would rather donate to a childrens charity that takes care of American children.	Are American children more important than non-American children?	In the scheme of things, a life is a life, but I am American and feel it important to help my fellow Americans	The children we help are in desperate need, however.	Can't you spare even a small donation?	Perhaps I could help out a little.	Where are you at?	You can check us out at  URL	are you based in America? are you an American?	We're an international NGO based in the UK.	looking at the link you provided, it appears that children in America also benefit from Save the Children donations.	Is that correct?	Ah, so you noticed. ;-)	I hate to be so prejudicial, but I care about the kids around me more than ones I cannot see!	Well, then.	You are a scallywag ninny!	I accept that!	How much of a donation are you looking for from me?	Well, your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Choose all of it!	all of it seems a little steep!	I would consider a smaller portion.	half would work for me.	Well, it's something.	Let's do it, then.	Half. Deal?	yes, fifteen cents	At least you're "half" decent. ;-)
20180826-182522_887_live	Hello there!	Where are you from?	Hi, I'm in Hawaii!	What kind of children's charities do you know about?	I've recently been informed of Save the Children.	Have you heard of this organization?	It sounds familiar.	What do they do?	Through the help of sponsorships and donations, they're working to help children...	I'm learning about this myself now, too.	Education, poverty issues, healthcare, emergency response.	That's not all...would you like to check out their website?	Sure, what is it?	Here is the link  URL	They look really good.	I think I've seen their commercials.	Me too.	Those commercials make me so sad!	In the U.S. and around the world, Save the Children does whatever it takes ??Â¸??Â¸ every day and in times of crisis ??Â¸??Â¸ to ensure children grow up healthy, learning and safe.	Learn about the places we work, the challenges children face and the results we achieve, thanks to supporters like me and you.	I see.	It seems like they're involved in a lot of areas.	Indeed.	They also make it really easy to donate, and every little bit helps.	How would you feel about donating a portion of your earnings from this task to Save the Children?	I would be fine with that.	I don't mind donating because I think the money is more important to them than it is to me.	Fantastic!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	How much would you like to give?	How about .20?	Great!	That's really good news.	I believe it will go to good use.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	That's nice.	I would like that.	Me too!	Thanks so much!	Have a great night!	Ok, you too.	Glad this worked out!

20180825-075913_208_live	Would you be interested in donating to Save the Children ?	I am one who like to donate.	Can you tell me more about it?	Save the Children helps to promote childrens rights to health, education, and safety.	Do they have any focus right now?	More as where are the majority of the fund headed towards right now/	At this point a lot of the focus is children in war zones.	some of these donations can address the problem of the daily threat of violence	It seems like Syria seems to be a high stakes area.	Are any fund going to help the the children in Hawaii after the volcano and hurricane?	I'm not sure, but I think that would be a great idea.	Maybe you could get more information on that by getting in contact with someone at  URL	What are some of the things that they do for the children?	I would like to donate but I am not a huge fan or donating just for promotion?	They help to provide basic health care, provide disaster relief, and help to ensure their rights to education and safety.	How much would you like to donate ?	Your donation will be deducted from your task payment.	I am interested in donating most of my task payment.	How would I go about this?	I do believe you have to go to  URL	Would 60% of the task payment be enough?	I know its not much.	Yes, that sounds good.	How much would that be ?	I think it would be roughly $1.20.	Is there a follow up on to see how my money while little is may be is being put to use?	I do believe you can get that information from their website.	Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me and also for your donation.	Take care and have a great day.	This charity seems to have children's best interests at heart.	I am very happy to help	Yes it does.	Now, how do we submit this hit ?	We still have chat a bit more.	Have you heard any break thought about this charity?	I am really interested.	You were asking about the hurricane relief in Hawaii.	From what I understand, they are on stand-by and ready to provide help if needed.	I think that is awesome.	I had no idea they operated in the USA also.	I always thought these organizations focused on other countries	That is very awesome.	I am proud to be apart of helping them help others	I also found out that 86% of donations goes to services and only 5% goes to management.	I was glad to hear that.	It was nice chatting with you.	I enjoyed this.	You take care and have a good day.
20180808-020257_457_live	Hello, how are you today?	I am doing good and you?	I am fine thanks, It's not been a long time I am on MTurk, but It is interesting how they are working on donating, Are you interested in donating?	Yes I donate to a few causes like breast cancer for women, autism awareness and March of dimes for children.	that is so nice of you.	Have you ever heard about the organization "Save the Children" ?	Yes I have but don't know a whole lot about them since there are so many children related charities.	This is one of the biggest charities working for children.	They work in almost 120 countries and on different issues related to children.	OK I will educate myself on them when we are done with our conversation.	That is good, We can talk about it too.	It is their website if you like to visit:  URL	OK thanks.	I reviewed the site quickly.	Sure is sad to see so many children in distress around the world.	Yes it makes me very sad too, but it is also nice to be able to help small even small amount.	I have a soft heart for children	Me too, since I am a parent of 2 children myself.	As a parent you want to do all you can for them.	I agree with you.	It makes my heart happy how people care about children.	I think HIT donation is a good thin since websites usually have minimum payment option, but on HITs we can donate 1 cent or more, makes it so much easier.	Yes I don't mind if there is a feature I can turn on where every hit I do, a few cents go to the charity of my choice.	That is so sweet.	I've learnt it from you.	I will do the same since now.	It might look small but I am sure it will end up big	Yes everything counts, that's how it starts.	All we could do is our part since problem is so big.	And for some countries even few dollars is a big thing, like for getting vaccinated.	It will guarantee many children's safety	I agree, Save the children foundation work with the children through out their lives to make sure they grow up in a safe environment and get a chance to succeed based on their website.	thank you for putting time on effort on this.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Thanks for your attention and help.	May all children live in health and happiness.	Have a nice day!	Thanks for your time too.

20180826-194841_403_live	Hello!	How are you tonight?	Hey, I am fine!!	How are you	How are you	I am good.	Have you heard of Save the children?	It sounds familiar.	I think I have heard of it.	I think I have heard of it.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, I just looked it up.	:)  I like that it's non-governmental.	Yes I love that too.	It ensures childrens right to health, education and so on.	Do you ever volunteer or make donations?	I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.	It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	You are an amazing person for caring for these  babies.	Animals are like children.	In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.	Save the Children is an amazing organization.	How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.	If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.	I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.	It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.	It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.	It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day.	Me too.	I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.	Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.	Would you be willing to donate from your task payment today?	Absolutely.	I hope everyone does.	I most definitely agree.	How much will you be donating today?	Whatever my task payment will be.	I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.	I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.	I completely understand that.	We are all trying to survive in life.	Thank you so much for your contribution.	Feel free to check out	URL if you would like to read more about the chairty.	I'm very sorry I can't donate more tonight.	I would if I had at least $200 in my bank account.	I hope it wsn't a waste of your time.	Oh no, you are awesome.	No need to be sorry.	You have not been a waste of time at all.	Thanks so much.	You're welcome!	It was nice talking, thanks for all you do.	God bless you.
20180903-165804_344_live	Hello, how are you today?	I AM doing well how are you	Wonderful!	Thank you.	Have you heard of a charity called Save the Children?	I have not	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights.	Would you like to know more?	No thank you.	Most of those places have so much overhead not much actually goes to the cause	Your individual donation will help individual children and their families.	I appreciate you telling me about this but I am not interested	What if I were to tell you that 100% of your donation would go directly to helping one child?	No thank you as there is no guarantee to this. I'd rather donate locally	I agree donating locally is also important.	However, there are so many children that could benefit from just pennies.	Again, no thank you	It will go to a trustable fund.	What if I match your donation?	I'm sorry I am to interested in donating to this.	Your donation could be directly deducted from your task payment.	Anywhere from a penny to $2	I will donate 0	Just 77 cents could help a refugee family and I will match the donation.	Again, I don't know how else I can say this	I will donate nothing to this.	I prefer to do this locally	Okay, then I have an option for you.	You have the ability to sponsor at child in the US!	We spend money on so many little things each day and we have the moral responsibility to help.	So if you would like to help locally, can you commit to doing that?	No I am sorry again	I will only do this in my town	This can go to sponsor a child in your town.	Can you just commit to 10 cents?
20180826-063853_537_live	0, 'hi..I;m mike	Hello Mike I am Pete	hi..pete, hows your life	My life is awesome and your?	it's great,I can't complain	What do you do for a living?

The charity I'm helping is called Save the Children.	oh how would you help the children	Well the charity collects money to help protect children's rights all across the globe.	oh ok thats nice	As you know, children can be extremely helpless, especially in third world countries, so they deserve all the help they can get.	i know i would like to help them with 5 dollars	$5 could make a huge different in a lot of kids lives.

You should have the option coming up to help you make a donation.	yes i like to give out things
20180826-064412_288_live	Hi.	Would you consider donating to Save the Children?	I might consider	Okay that's a start.	Well Save the Children is a very reputable organization and your donation would be used for a good purpose.	do you donate?	No, honestly I don't but I would feel like my money would go to a good cause if I were to	I appreciate your honesty	We could all do better, I suppose.	These organizations only ask for a small amount that we may spend on coffee each day or snacks we don't need.	I hear you.	I do believe in donations, but my only worry is that the money doesn't go to where I think it is going.	I prefer to volunteer is I can	That's a good idea actually, that way you know for sure your efforts are helping.	But the places I do donate are often revolved around helping children, so this is a great organization	It only takes pocket change for us to help out.	I agree.	you never know who you could be helping	Do your family or friends donate to such causes?	We do.	My mom is on the board for a few nonprofits that we attend fundraisers for.	That is a great way to raise money	Wow.	Well you've seen charity first-hand.	Yes, I try to help as much as I can, but it's hard when you are broke	I definitely understand.	Sometimes it's more a matter of convenience, too.	It doesn't take much to save 30c a week or something.	that is true, but its hard to justify that 30c is going to make any difference	Well,in America, of course that's nothing.	But in developing countries it could be huge.	that is a very good point
20180825-073629_433_live	Have you ever though about donating to Save the Children?	I have thought about it before.	I've been approached by people on the street.	It is a really great charity.	It helps children who have been in crisis.	Is the charity international?	Or do they operate primarily in America?	It donates all over the world including America.	What is the purpose of the charity?	To help children in crisis.	Right now they Stand Ready to Help Hawaii Kids and Families as Powerful Hurricane Lane Closes in	That's really a great cause.	Unfortunately I don't have much money right now to help.	Anything is helpful.	You can donate as little as a $1	I don't know that I can donate a dollar.	I've been working really hard to save every dollar that I can to make sure I can pay my bills.	You can donate right now right from your task payment	I don't know if I'd necessarily feel comfortable donating.	I feel like a lot of charities squander the money and don't actually use all the donations for what is promised.	If you donate from your task payment today the research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Is there anyway that I can be guaranteed the money will go towards what is promised?	No, you just have to trust the requester will do the right think	Are there any other charities I can donate to?	Or is it just save the children?	No, today is just the Save the Children.	Is there any way that I could donate less than a dollar?	I don't want to donate a dollar, but would consider donating something less.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment for this task.	So yes you can less	I would be willing to donate 5 cents today.	I know it's not a lot, but it's all I'm willing to afford today.
20180826-181249_805_live	I was wanting to see if you would be willing to donate to a charity called Save the Children.	They promote childrens rights, provide relief and helps support children in developing countries.	maybe	So many children die every day due to starvation and acts of violence in these developing countries.	These children are not given the same opportunity at education as you and I.	Just a small  donation of .50 could help imact a childs life.	that is not bad	Think about the unnecessary money that you spend on small things everyday like a snack or bag of candy.	Most of these children will never know what it is like to go into a store and purchase something of such luxury.	yeah, that is true.	spend lots of money on beer	Most people find they get great satisfaction from helping someone out.	You might find that you will eel the same way.	how are the donations made?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	ok.  it only pays $0.30 though	It is your choice what you would like to donate so if you want to do .30 you can.	ok that would be fine	How much would you like to donate to the charity?	$0.25 is a good amount	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	that sounds good	Do you feel satisfaction from your generous donation today?	yes, that is fine	Thank you very much for you help!	thank you and hope it helps
20180723-072435_196_live	Hey, how are you doing?	Hi, i'm doing great! how are you?	Doing ok here.	Glad to hear your day is great.	Do you have a moment to talk about children causes?	sure!	I would like to	Have you ever heard of the charity, Save the Children?	no, but i would like to know more about it	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	that's great.	Do you have any more information about it?	Yea.	Have you heard of children getting separated from their family at the US-Mexico border?	yes, it's so heartbreaking1	Save the Children are helping to reunite them with their family.	that's really good to hear!	I can't imagine not being able to see my son!	Children shouldn't be separated from their families.	It is very heartbreaking to hear, and I'm glad Save the Children stepped in.	So what exactly do they do to help these kids to reunite with their parents?	They identify the parents who were deported back to their countries of origin, while their children remain separated and detained in the U.S. As these parents are identified, they work to help them locate and safely reunite with their children, and from there, support them in getting access to essential services they need to re-establish themselves.	awesome!	I'm so gonna support it!	Children should be with their parents!!	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0.50 to all your payment.	I can't donate less than 0.50?	Sure.	What amount would you feel comfortable donating?	i'm not sure.	I'm in a tough financial situation right now so i really need money but i would like to donate.

I am sure it will get to your child.	well maybe you could donate to my child.	since you are so into helping out kids	It would be best to donate to a specialized organization to allocate the funds in a proper, efficient way so all children can get the maximum benefit from the money.	how do we do that	The research team here will collect all donations and send it to the Save the Children.	This lump sum will be used to buy mass quantities of supplies at inexpensive prices.	how much will you donate	All of it	how much should i give?	I would give all you have.	It would be easy for you to get it back but for the children, this would be huge
20180808-013755_350_live	Good morning.	It is early in the morning on the East Coast of the USA where I am.

Do you do a lot of charity work.	I do a fair amount	ok what can i help with that	I do mostly charity walks and donations.	How about you	i did only charity walks and rare to take the donations	Charity walks are great.	I usually like to focus on charities that help children since I think they are most vulnerable	i also usually focus that	Often times I do ones that deal with local family shelters with children, cancer for children etc but many times I do Unicef and Save the Children.	Have you heard of those	i mostly deal with friend and other persons	Me too but right now there is a great need for help internationally.	One of the organizations I know of is the Save the Children.	It  is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	support children in more development country?	yes, because really we have a lot of support in the US but so many countries just do not have the infrastructure or governmental or non governmental structure to help in any real way.	Save the children goes in and provides food and other relief	food also the main problem of the more countries	I am not sure if you are aware but the research team for this task will collect any donations we make from the payment of the task  and send it to Save the Children	awareness is less than the more countries so they need some help	right.	I mean $1 to you and I in the United States is really not much but to children in developing countries it is huge when all added up together for the Save the Children program	yes of course	This task pays $2.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and the researchers will pay via Save the Children.	Would you like to join me and donate $1 as part of it to the charity now?	Amazing outcome and we still get a good payment	no $5 to spend us	We only get $2 so we cannot donate $5 Would you like to donate $1 of the $2?	yes of course
20180719-165941_192_live	Hello	Yea, hello.	Glad you took your time.	I'd like to speak to you about Save the Children.	Do you have any kids?	No, I do not have kids.	What is Save the Children about?	Save the Children is an international non-governemnt organization.	Their goal is to promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That sounds really cool.	What specific countries do they help out?	They help out many third world countries from all over the world.	Okay.	I guess I would look them up sometime to find out more.	How do you feel about those who were unluckily born to poor circumstances?	I feel like it's a shame and I wish we could do more.	How can I help?	You sound like a really kind person.

That will make a difference in many of their lives.	Yes.	There is. Url	IT looks really good and professional.	I am definitely going to donate.	Thank you.	It will be appreciated it.	Is there any other information you can share with me that I shuld know about?	Absolutely.	Recently, we will have been involved in the US-Mexico border crisis involved with separating children from their parents at the border.	That sounds awesome.	I wish you all luck in that.	Thank you.	It will be difficult, but we are focused in reuniting the children with their family.	The separation should never have happened.	I definitely agree with that.	It takes a lot to fix this country already so your effort is definitely astounding.
20180825-073813_141_live	Have you ever heard of "Save the Children"?	It an agency that helps children in underdeveloped and developing countries.	No, I actually haven't .	Do you have any more information about the organization that you could tell me?	it is not sponsored or supported by any governmental agencies and it helps children abroad and within the US.	You would be shocked at how many children live in poverty here in the United States.	I have an idea.	Whats a more specific idea of what you do?	How do you help?	Whats their overall goal?	Well, a very specific goal right is to help the children that are separated from their parents due to our current immigration problem.	Can you imagine someone taking your small child away from you and not knowing where they are going, who is going to be caring for them, or if you will ever be able to see them again?	As a mother, that thought is horrifying.	It is horrifying, I could not even imagine.	What do you need me to do?	Save the Children has committed to providing some of the care and needs for these children until they can be reunited with their parents.	Would you be willing to donate your pay for this task to Save the Children so they can continue to provide care for these misplaced children?	My pay?	As in my weekly paycheck?	Or are there any other payment options, as I have bills to pay.	No, but you could donate part of your pay for this particular task here.	Say, maybe half of your payment for this task or even the whole thing?	I will happily donate my whole payment for this task. :)	Thank you!	Save the Children is a very reputable charity and your donation will mean so much!	I am so grateful there is a way for me to help financially!!!	It really is a great charity and has been around for over 100 years!	And while the current immigration crisis is a relatively new problem, they stand ready to help in whatever capacity they can.	That is fantastic to hear!!	It has been a pleasure chatting with you and donating your task pay to this fine cause should get you some good Karma for the remainder of your day!!	Thank you!	You will as well for all the hard work you're putting towards this magnificent charity.	You are quite welcome!!	You can send me the information with the email you have on file for me. :)	ok, I will get it out to as soon as possible!	Thank you so much for your time and the effort you are putting towards this very reputable charity!!

20180808-034448_815_live	Hi there.	Have you ever thought about who the most vulnerable people are when a natural disaster strikes?	Or when there's political unrest?	That is something I do not think about.	Actually, I'm really troubled by the answer.	In countries like Syria, 1000 children have been killed during the civil war.	Isn't that insane?	That is terrible.	I wish this wasn't true.	Seriously.	Adults often can't fend for themselves when there's a crisis, but children are especially vulnerable.	Do you think that if you could do something to help Syrian children or children in Indonesia, which just experienced an earthquake, you would?.	That would be something I would do, yes.	Yeah, me too.	Every day I watch the news and hear about victims all over the world and feel kind of powerless.	You have more power than you realize.	Can you elaborate.	How do you think people like us could help?	We could either donate money or our time.	Absolutely.	There are so many charities out there but I\'ve been researching one in particular called "Save the Children."	All of the money they collect goes straight to helping children in war torn parts of the world and places that have suffered natural disasters.	I will have to take a look at the website.	Is there any information that I could provide you with.	I really believe in this organization and think it's worthwhile.	How long has the organization been around?	It's actually been around since 1919, when it was founded by this woman in London right after World War I	What is the womens name that founded it?	I have to be honest with you.	I'm going to look that up.	Her name is Eglantyne Jebb.	Who runs the organization now?	Well, a woman named Carolyn Miles is the CEO.	Are you familiar with the organization?	No I am not, but like I said.	I will look at it in the future.	I know I haven't given you that much info, but do you think you might want to donate part of your proceeds for this task to Save the Children?	It's a great NGO that is really making a difference in developing countries.
20180826-192022_0_live	Hello, may I ask how interested are you in children and their quality of life right now	I am very interested!	I think it is important to support children from all walks of life.	Have you ever thought about donating to an organization that helps children in need?	I absolutely have, most recently to support children who were separated from their parents entering the country.	That is great to hear, but sadly there is not much that that organization can do, as a lot of children in poor countries don't even get the chance to live past the 15 years of age	Is there a particular organization or charity you are thinking of?	Yes, it is called Save The Children, it is an organization dedicated to ensure safety, education, health and other basic needs for kids in poor countries	That sounds very interesting.	What sorts of things do they do to ensure those things?	And what countries do they provide support in?	They mostly help kids in the African continent, but also in Asian countries like Nepal and Butan, where there is simply no way for kids to access education unless their parents are rich.	They work hand in hand with the red cross and UNICEF to bring help to those in need, often aiding personally with their voluntaries besides cooperating with the money	Wow that is amazing!	How long has this organization been volunteering?	They are about to celebrate their 10th anniversary next year	That sounds like they have a pretty strong foundation.	I like that they provide educational support for the children.	I like that too, perhaps you would be interested in donating something to them?	I might be interested.	What ways can I donate?	You can visit their site to do so, or visit one of their physical locations if they are nearby	Do you know where they have offices?	They have offices in most cities of USA and Canada, if you are not near, you can always visit their website	I will definitely have to check their website out.	Do you know if they support children in the US who do not have access to education or other basic necessities?	They do most probably, they care for al children in need equally	That is wonderful, thank you for all the information.	So, how much would you like to donate to this organization?
20180808-035431_488_live	Hello, how are you today?	I'm good.	What Children's charity would you like to donate money to?	I like to donate, but i have a soft heart for children too.	I recently read about "Save the Children" and red more about it.	Save the Children sounds like a good charity to me as well.	Yes I like how they are clear about their financial reports and They are a big organization	Clear financial reports are a very good thing.	They work with children all around the world.	Correct?	Yes they work in 120 different countries, on different issues.	Wow, that's amazing.	Definitely a charity that I could stand behind and support.	Same here, they have many option to help, We can donate or We can participate in their events	I don't know much about their events.	But I have money that I can donate.	I usually like to help financially too, since I do not have many off days to join event.	Some of their members even travel to different countries to help in person.	I believe that is a big thing to do	I wouldn't have the time off to do that.	But that's pretty cool what they do.	Yes, they are also connected to big companies like IKEA and Walt Disney.	I would like to see part of my purchase will be donated	Donating part of a purchase is such an easy way for a large amount of people to donate money.	Exactly, I also like how there are HITs which encourage you to donate.	It makes me happy to donate part or all of my bonus	If it's a charity I believe in that's a great way.	I donate to many local charities in my city.	that is so nice of you.	like "Save the Children" has many options to donate.	You can directly donate through website, It has a minimum amount, but you can also donate part of the HIT reward at the end of the conversation, It can be 0 or 1 cent or any other amount	I think I'll probably donate at the end of this conversation.	Will you be doing so as well?	I sure will.	I did it in the past.	and surprisingly my reward did not even change	I've had similar things happen.	I'm glad we good agree on a charity to donate to.
20180825-075658_709_live	Hi!	How are you doing today?	Would you be interested today in making a donation to a charity?	Which charity would that be?	The charity we're taking donations for is save the children!	I've seen a lot of commercials about them, but never did a lot of research about them.	They are actually really great.	They provide help to children all across the globe and stand up for children's rights.	I know some charities only give a small percentage of donations to children and the rest go to their employees wages.	Do they?	I thought that too at first, but luckily save the children is a non-governmental charity, so no one is sticking their hands into the pot.	Thats good, I see they are ready to help out with the hurricane in Hawaii for the kids.	Yes!	You have to think about how helpless children can be.	Every penny can make a huge difference even if it doesn't feel like it.	Do you regularly try to help the organization yourself?	I don't personally work for save the children, but I myself have donated several times to the charity.	I feel confident that my money goes to the right places.	Yes, I like to help whenever I can when it comes to children.	They are helpless.	That's great!	So do you think you'd be willing to make a donation?	Do you make donations on line or mail it in?	You can actually donate directly	Where, on their website?	I'm sorry my last message was cut off.	You can actually make a donation directly from this task!	Ok, I would like to.	Maybe ten dollars I can do.	That would be an incredible donation that could really go a super long way for save the children!	Ok, I will definitely help out.	Thank you so much for your generosity.	On behalf of Save The Children, THANK YOU!	you should be prompted on a following screen to donate and you can enter your donation there :) Have a great day!	Have a great day!
20180825-075630_493_live	Hi!	How are you doing today?	I'm doing well.	How about you?	I am great, just enjoying some coffee on my deck.	How is the weather for you?	It's cloudy a lot, but otherwise fine.	I was just looking through the morning mail.	A request by a children's charity for a donation.	Which charity was the flyer from?	The charity I always donate to is called Save The Children.	They do wonders for under privileged kids.	I think it was from Save The Children.	So you think they do some actual good?	They do for sure.	They feed so Many starving kids and are quick to respond to any crisis.	That's encouraging.	Do you usually donate?	They're asking for $50, I was thinking more like $20.	I do donate regularly to them.	In fact if you are wanting to donate you can donate a portion of your payment from this directly to Save The Children.	Is that something you would be willing to do?	That's a thought.	I guess I could do that.	Maybe 1/2 of the payment.	That is wonderful!	So you are willing to donate half of your payment?	I will also donate mine.	Okay.	Let's do that then.	Great!	These donations will be able to help so many children!	That's the goal, for sure.	It absolutely is!	I just want to thank you for helping out this great charity.	Glad to help.	I have a needy child of my own, and know how desperate that can make you feel.	Absolutely!	I hope you enjoy your day, and if you would like to learn more about this charity, you can visit their website.	I may do that.	Enjoy your day also.	Thank you!	You are welcome.
20180824-022557_24_live	Hello there.	Have you heard of a charity called Save the Children?	no	It is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	The organisation promotes policy changes in order to gain more rights for young people, especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child.	Alliance members co-ordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the effects of war and violence.	That sounds extremely awesome.	Yeah, it was founded in 1919, so it's coming up on 100 years.	Congratulations to them.	They're really everywhere.	They even help deal with hurricane relief efforts here in the United States, as they did with Hurricane Harvey last year.	That's good because hurricanes have devastating effects.	Would you like to donate a portion of the earnings from this task to Save the Children?	The research team will collect the donations and send them to Save the Children.	I think I'm ok.	All right, thank you for your time.	you're welcome, that was fun	Oh, I see, this conversation has to go for 10 turns EACH.	It does.	I think the charity sounds pretty good.	Yeah, I mistimed that.	That's on me.	Its all good bud.	Switching tasks all the time can be very difficult.	Yeah.	Such is Mturk life.	Not very much of a life.	Maybe we will get a dollar.	lol	Haha, touche. GL	same to you and good night
20180719-211253_768_live	Hey, good to be chatting with you tonight.	Hi!	Looking forward chatting with you too.	I'd like to talk to use about a vulnerable group.	Do you have a moment?	Yes, I do	I'd like to talk about children.	What was life like for you growing up?	Did you have to worry about your basic needs at all?	Like food, place to live, safety, etc?	There were periods in my childhood when money was very short and we had our telephone or power cut off, but I always had a safe place to live and food to eat.	It is really difficult having to grow up having to worry about basic needs.	I'm glad you are able to look for what to be grateful for.	What was life like for you growing up?	Did you have any worries about food, shelter, safety, etc.?	I guess there are more people than we know who grew up with no worries.	I grew up worrying about my safety and whether I'd have a place to live.	My dad was a gambling addict.	I don't have any experiences like that but I'm sure it must have been very difficult and scary to go through that as a child.	Thank you.	I really appreciate your sympathizing, and I'm glad I got to share that with someone.	Did you ever use the services of any organizations for children to help you through the rough times?	No I didn't, but I now donate to them.	What about you?	No, I didn't either.	My family would just get through somehow.	I have made donations in the past, but our money is bit tight since I'm a stay-at-home mom right now.	If I make donations now, they are in-kind donations rather than monetary donations.	What organizations do you donate to?	I tend to make donations to a emergency children's shelter.	That's understandable.	We all do what we can to help each other.	I donate to Save the Children.	Have you heard about them?	Yes, I have.	That's great.	Also, did you know that not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping children very near to us?	No, I didn't know that they are helping children near to us.	Do you mean in the USA?	No actually, at the border.	Children were separated at the US-Mexico border from their parents, and Save the Children are working on getting them back to their family.	I didn't realize that.	I've been following the news about family separations very closely.	I'm glad organizations like Save the Children are helping.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	ou can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Sure, I will donate 50 cents to them.
20180826-053845_531_live	Save the Children is an amazing charity that helps kids who are in desperate need.	They can help with safety, education and more.	You can donate some of your earnings to this amazing charity.	I believe in this charity, but still wonder how much of the money I donate actually helps.	Every little bit makes a difference.	When you have people who are so poor, it's amazing what a tiny amount can do.	I would gladly give my earnings to this charity.	Children hold the future of the world.	It is really so heartbreaking when you see all of these kids not having enough to eat.	It really breaks the heart.	They are so little.	I know, it always amazes me how many children are suffering around the world.	It is so sad.	Even the little bit you donate from your earnings can go a long way to making a difference for a child.	Though MTurk they should raise quite a bit.	Even though it is only .30 for this hit, with the number of people it adds up.	That's what happens.	Even small amounts make such a big difference when they are added up.	That's why it does make such a difference to even do small things.	In my personal life I do pay attention to all the details and the reviews of charities.	There are so many worthy causes that I try hard to make sure my meeker amounts go to benefit the most.	And Save the Children is a great charity.	They really do help so many kids and people.	I know they are a well established charity so should have all the resources, administration wise, to get the money where it is needed most.	I think it's wonderful that you are doing this and are going to donate.	It is such a great thing to do.	It makes me feel that even though not enough I have done a little something.	You do what you can, and that is all that matters.	But you should feel good about this little amount.	I live in a very rural area, people in my town are extremely poor and it still amazes me how they will take what little they have and take care of each other.	It is very sweet.	And these small things just make such a difference.	It is hard to watch and not reach out to help a child.	I do what I can in my own community and the town comes together this time of year to make sure each child has school supplies.	It is really sad that Save a Child exists, the world should be a safe place for children and there should be no need.	It should be. But with people helping it can at least make a difference.	I think everyone can do their part.	I agree, it has been very nice chatting with you and I hope you have a great day.	Thank you so much.	Can you tell me now how much you would like to donate?	You can choose any amount to all your payment.	I will donate all of my payment.
20180826-062356_655_live	hi how are you	good morning.	I am well thank you and you?	I'm fine, you've heard about the child support organization	Is that the organization that is helping single parents obtain support from absent parents?	not a nonprofit organization that helps kids around the world, I've gotten to save $ 100	I have not heard about it.	What do you mean you have gotten to save $100,  You are saying it isn't a non profit?	I've donated $ 100 to this organization, sorry	I see.	What does the organization provide?	Is it a non profit?	The Save the Children Fund, commonly known as Save the Children, is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I have heard of Save the Children Fund.	I will be honest, what I had heard though wasnt positive.	yes it is a very positive organisation	I typically give to local charities that use the funds to help in the community.	I then can see the money at work.	I am not saying that world charities are not needed but I rather give to local charities.	i am a person positive and help the children	It is great to be a helpful person.	We have a school here in my small town for children from broken homes.	I typically give to them.	I give a lot of money to the children in need, with pain everywhere they are	The Children's Hope Alliance in our town provides housing and schooling for children.	They are strictly non profit so we give what we can including clothes and books.	yes i give very much money	I know the children are very grateful!	there are the future of the word	this is true.	Thank you and have a great day

Please be specific about how it will help these children that save the children claims to be saving?	I am an informed donor and want to make sure my money is really helping these children	the research team will collect all donations and send it to save the children	It sounds like my money won't be used to directly help the children.	What does 5 dollars get these children?	and what country or countries are these children located in	im not really sure	Well, is this a lobal charity that will be using my money to spread across their whole organization or will it help buy these children new schools which is a cause that I am really passionate about?

20180827-033412_606_live	Hi would you like to donate to the Save the Children Foundation?	I would like to know more about the charity before making a decision.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Okay interesting.	How do I know I can trust the charity will do the promised thing with my donation?	You just have to trust me.	Your donation will go towards helping the fight for children's rights to health, education, safety and so on.	I'm asking you to donate your entire task payment to this foundation.	What countries would my donation be helping?	Many different countries, especially war zones...	One that hits close to home for me is Syria.	Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your small donation could help at least one of these children live a life without fear.	Okay I am interested but I wouldn't want to donate my entire task payment.	Can I donate another amount?	The whole task amount isn't much to us but would be so much to them but I understand.	How much of it would you be willing to donate?	0.15 half of my payment.	I have a family to provide for and any little bit helps.	But I also would like to help others.	Wow that's awesome.	I totally understand about having to support a family too.	I love the idea of helping others also, any little way that I can.	Is there anything else I should know about the charity?	Something I found pretty cool is Save The Children actually helped children fully recover in Texas after Hurricane Harvey.	I like the idea that they are worldwide.	Wow they really have a far reach.	That is wonderful what they are doing for our world.	Yes it is.	They are a huge advocate to children.	They believe that children make up 20% of our population but are 100% of our future and I couldn't agree more.	Children truly are our future.	We need to care for them as we will need them in our old age.	Yes, your donation will go to help one of millions of children.	If you would like to be a sponsor for about a dollar a day you can go to  URL and sign up.	In 2015, 183,000 sponsors like you supported programs that directly benefited more than 2.8 million children in 23 countries around the world ??Â¸??Â¸ including the United States.	Thanks to our growing community of child sponsors, we increased our impact and reach ??Â¸??Â¸ helping 29% more children than we did in 2014	Wow that is a lot of sponsors.	Are you a sponsor?	Honestly, I am not.	But after doing this task and reading up on the website I am going to sign up.	I love to do charity work.	I also do alot of local volunteer work.	Any way I can help a defenseless child I will.	I always place my own child in their shoes.	That's motivation enough... to picture my babies going through what these kids go through.	Thank you for being so informative and helpful!	I love to think that we are making a small but important impact with this task.
20180826-013529_897_live	Hey, do some good, give some money to kids.	Sure.I would be glad to. How much money do you think I should give?	oh, could you afford maybe fifteen cents?	I can afford $5.00	that sounds pretty good, I would definitely accept that	How much would you donate?	well, I'll match your 5.00, does that sound cool?	Yeah, that sounds great. I love donating to charity. I think it is important to help those less fortunate.	yes there are so many in terrible need	I donate a portion of my paychecks to feed the children. Do you have a favorite charity?	yes I like to give to doctors without borders, they risk their lives to go where they are most needed	Oh wow, I would also be interested in donating to that.	there are so many wars and so many natural disasters	It really breaks my heart. I wish I could help everyone in need.	it is so hard to make a choice	I feel bad about only giving $5, do you think we should give more?	wish that we could, but like all working on MTurk we are poor ourselves	Very true. $5 it is. At least we are giving something. Most people wouldn't.	yes that is so true, so often it is just left to governments to do	If everyone would just give something, everyone could have food and a warm place to sleep.
20180827-035202_980_live	Hello.	Have you ever heard of the organization Save the Children?	I haven't	They are an amazing organization with a national and an international presence.	Would you like to know more about what they do?	I think I'm okay.	No need to share more information	I understand and I do not want to take up too much of your time.	But please know that this organization ehlps children on every continent but Antartica.	Why not Antartica?	There just isn't the population to warrant it.	The climate is not sustainable for human life and children do not reside there.	But in the other countries they provide emergency response, global advocacy,  literacy, and health education.	Well that's disappointing.	What country receives the most aid?	It is spread out by need but rest assured that their charity ranges from Kentucky all the way to Kenya.	Also, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so everyone that donates knows that their money is being used for a good cause rather than misappropriated.	Okay sounds interesting.	How do people donate to the charity?	You can visit their website or I can assist you with donating today.	Can I ask if you have ever donated to a charity before?	Yes I have in the past, but not recently	Glad to hear it.	Charity is very important.	Is this a charity you believe to be doing a good thing based on the information I have provided?	Sounds like a good mission, but I probably won't be able to donate	Any little bit helps.	Even a dollar or less can be used to do great things.	Small donations add up quickly.	Yes, I've heard that before.	Like March of Dimes and the Salvation Army	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0	I'm sorry to hear that.	I hate to push but is there any chance you could give just $0.25?	No thanks.	I like to keep my money for now.	I understand.	You have a good day.	I understand.	You have a good day.

20180808-032041_562_live	Have you ever heard of the 'Save The Children' charity?	I have!	I think it's a great chairty.	I think the work they do is great.	Helping kids in impoverished nation is a really noble thing to do.	I agree, how frequently do you donate?	I generally do my charitable donations around Christmas, when I had an influx of extra cash.	You?	Similiar, I only donate when I have the money to spare.	You can help now!	You can donate any amount from your task payment to Save the Children now if you'd like.	I'm not sure if I want to, but I can give a little.	How much would you like to give?	The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children.	I'll give 5 cents.	I'll do the same.	Great, I'm glad we're helping a little.	I imagine a lot of people end up doing these hits.	It probably adds up, assuming everyone pitches in a little.	Agreed, which is probably what they want.	I'd assume so.	I've done hits kind of like this, where the end goal seemed to be to gauge peoples charitable giving with their task payments.	oh yeah, absolutely!!	I'm a sucker for helping people when I can.	At least you're doing some good, though.	You too!	Thanks for the 5 cents.	It was nice talking to you.	Nice talking to you as well.
20180825-090032_956_live	Hi, how are you today?	Have you ever considered donating to Save the Children?	It is a great kids'	Hi I am fine and yourself?	I'm good.	Save the Children is one of the best children's charities around.	They do really great work.	Have you ever thought about the benefits from the donations?	Do the donations actually help the organization?	Yes, they really do.	It is an international organization that promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries.	How long has the organization been established and what is the success rate of the program?	Save the Children is proud to be named one of the MacArthur Foundation 100&Change Charities with Bold Solutions.	This company looks more like a firm than a charity	Every charity needs to be organized in order to help the people it represents.	It is 100% dedicated to helping children.	You can donate as much or as little as you want.	The cost of a cup of coffee even.	This is true but alot of charities don't represent the individuals they portray to help.	I agree, there are some bad charities out there.	This is not one.	They have never waivered in their devotion to helping children since they established in 1919.	Ok if that were true what is their succession rate of getting through to the children or progression rate.	n fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.	You can donate by clicking on a link at the end of this task.	Just donating a small portion of your earnings are a big help.	Thats program services not to the kids themselves.	Did they provide housing for kids that went against their culture beliefs?	Yes they did.	They use  9 out of every 10 dollars spent  towards programs and services for children and families in need.	They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.	And how is the charity promoted?	Through internet ads?	They mostly use press releases.	I don't really see much in the way of internet ads.	Seriously though,  just think about giving up 1 cup of coffee/drink a day or just donating though the link at the end of this task what you would be making off of it.	Every little bit helps.	Small donations are better than nothing at all!	They should probable do internet promotion.	As far as donating I have no problem donating to a greater cause as long as it benefits others short term and long term.	I don't purchase coffee	Perfect, shall you be donating at the end of this task?	No i will not until I do further research.
20180808-004203_194_live	Hi	hello	Would you like to help an important cause?	Depends on which one you are talking about.	It's for children	Sounds interesting but can you be a bit more specific?	It's called SAVE the CHILDREN.	It help poor kids in need of food and shelter	Does it help children in this country or in another country?	It helps kids in this country	Great!	I believe my money should first focus on children in need in this country.	Great.	How much would you like to help with?	Before I commit to a donation, can you tell me how much actually goes to the children and how much goes to the organization itself?

20180825-064838_945_live	hi!	hi, how are you?	I am well, thank you	I guess we're supposed to be talking about a children's charity..?	yes, do you donate to charities often?	No, not really.	Do you?	I try to do what I can, but its hard sometimes	I agree.	What would motivate you to donate to a children's charity?	I think save our children is incredibly important, becuase children are the ones who need it most.	You're right, it is very important.	Would you prefer to donate clothes, food, money, or something else?	With save the children, money is most important, since they can use it to get all of the necessary needs for children met.	That makes sense.	We should donate money then.	I completely agree.	One of the kids you could be helping could be the next president or osmething!	Very true!	It's important to give every child an opportunity to succeed.	I agree.	Think about all the children in war torn areas and all of the physical and emotional support they need.

Are we supposed to mutually agree to both give a certain amount?	No but this doesn't end till you do.	You have to name a specific amount then I match it.	Do small I think	I would be willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cent payment to help save children.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I'm good with them doing that.	Like mentioned I'm willing to give 10 cents of the 30 cents.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

More about the charity?	The instructions weren't super clear on my end.	Mine either.	Gah!	I just copied and pasted what they said.	maybe say "I will donate .10 of my .30 payment."	I will donate 10 cents of my 30 cent payment.	You should  type the same  thing and if perhaps if you know anything about the charity, share it?	This is a great charity and I will match you .10 cent payment.	Okay,  so we are in agreement on the payment  to the charity.	I assume save the children would be able helping children in three world countries.	I wish they were way more specific in the instructions on both ends.	Aha their are 10 minimum chat turns required, we are almost there.	I will match .10 cents	oh, I didn't know that I just assumed if we reached an agreement before that they would let us advance.

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children	oh so specifically in third world countries were they are mistreated or does it include first world countries as well?	Yes working in Syria right now.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children	Yes, they need all the help they can get there after the missiles and chemical attacks
20180824-023730_85_live	Hi how are you today?	good	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I have not, but there are other charities I like to participate in	Do you have any children?	I have two.	i do not but hope to some day.	what are your children's age ?	They are all grown up now Would you consider donating to Save the Children?	Yes I will donate	Wow that would be cool What are your other favorite charities?	I think Red Cross does a broad array of services	Yes they do I like St Judes Childrens Hospital also	I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people	That's a good outlook.	I think its good there are some speciality ones out there also though.	I agree.	I dont think there is any shortage of people who need help.	I like to be able to help as many as possible	I guess having had children the St Judes hospital makes you think what if and what would i do	Your perspective is helpful.	This reminds me of Ronald McDonald as well	Yes the way they work together is great.	The parents never have to pay anything or worry about anything but their child.	I had heard about the McDonald's charity and see the change box, but I did not know much about it until a customer told me his son used their services when i was getting food once	I know Shriners has helped a couple people I know when they were children they each had a club foot and poor parents and shriners did all the surgery for free	That is very interesting.	Do you know anyone personally who has benefited from charities ?	I have helped at soup kitchens before but that's my own extent
20180825-143255_249_live	Hi have your head of save the childrens?	No, I have not.	Please tell me about it	It is an organization that promotes children rights, provides help and support in developing countries.	What countries are helped through this organization?	Countries all over the world for example Africa.	Children need our help to be healthy and taken care of and a dontation on your part would put is one step forward in completing this goal!	Approximately how many children per year receive help?	Millions.	Just $1.00 could help tramendously.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	If we had more help by people like you.	These things could be avoided.	Are there different tiers of donations?	All of the dontations go toward one cause.	Some people donate 100$ and some only donate $1.00.	I'm asking you, instead of buying that purse or clothing item, spend it on helping children in need.	How do I donate?	The research team will collect all the donations, you just have to say how much you want to donate	How am I charged for donations?	The amount of the donation will be taken out of your task payment	I see  thank you for your information.	Your welcome!	Thank you	I will donate 10 cents.	Thank you.	Our team will collect that and you will be helping children in need.	Thank you for your time	No problem thank you	Have a good evening
20180723-042421_113_live	This site Helps many child	What kind of children does it help?	Their motto is to help children's future...that every child deserves a future	What is the name of the organization?	Save the Children	How do they help children?	Food?	Clothing?	Shelter?	Education?	They help in the children's basic need like food and clothing.	They help in whatever it takes for children to transforming their lives and the future	Is this charity local?	global?	Just in my country (United States)?	This charity is from Fairfield Town in Connecticut	I think  it's important to support initiatives to help children get a good education, and have the things they need to go to school and learn.	How much should we donate?	Ya.. It's very important.	There are many way to donate money like one time gift, Monthly donor, and sponsorship for some children.	Sponsorship of a child might be interesting....I'd like to know what my donation is being used for, and that it's actually helping someone.	Child sponsorship works like a way of giving and that connects one compassionate person like you with one child in need.	Sponsoring a child gives the chance to grow up healthy, educated and safe ??Â¸??Â¸ forever changing the course of their life and future.	You can select a child according to your choice by age, gender	That is appealing.	Does the charity send updates on how the child is doing if I sponsor?	Ya... Definitely they will update you every information about the child you are donating	How does the sponsorship work?	Do I make a monthly donation?	I can't afford much.	What is the minimum dollar amount?	You can Sponsor a child for just $36 a month	What do you think?	Ya.. It will definitely work and save the children's future..	OK. Glad that we came to an agreement.	How do we end this task?
20180825-075611_866_live	Hello how are you this morning.	I'm good, and you?	I'm very well, thank you.	Well the reason I'm contacting you is because I'm trying to find donors for the Save the Children foundation.	Your donation will help ensure children's rights to health, education and safety.	Your donation can help children in need reach their full potential and what's really more important that our children as they are our future.	How much money are you looking for?	Any amount of donation would help in this cause.	It's surprising how little can make an impact on these kids.	The amount of donation is completely up to you	How much of my donation goes to the kids	Everything you donate will go to the save the children foundation.	What kind of supplies does my donation provide	The supplies vary based on need.	Right now they are funding medical and school supplies for kids.	As well as preparing a fund to help with whatever damage comes from the hurricane that is bearing down on Hawaii right now.	So if this just for children in America?	No, they do help children all over the world.	Such as children in Syria who have lost everything from parents to homes due to the conflict they are experiencing, children in Africa who have been orphaned and just need care,	Id like to make a donation, how do I do that	You can choose to donate your some or all of your payout from this task.	The agreement will be recorded from this chat and deducted from your account.	What if i'd like to donate more	You can always donate more at  URL	I think I'd like to donate 0.05	Ok I understand that you would like to donate .05 of your payout to save the children.	Thank you so much as every little counts and I appreciate your donation	You're welcome, is there anything else that I can do to help	Nope that would be all for today.	Thank you for supporting the children of the world.	Great.	Thanks for the oppertunity.
20180825-080802_964_live	Hi, good morning!	Hello!	Were you able to read a little about the charity Save the Children?	No, I didn't see anything.	I'm a little familiar with the charity though.	Oh, awesome!	Well, in case you didn't know, Save the Children is a great charity that focuses on helping kids around the world.	They use almost 90% of all donations directly to help children in the areas of education, safety and emergency...	That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	Yes, exactly.	I'm not a fan of charities that keep a lot of their proceeds for themselves.	That's one reason I really like this one.	Do you think you would be willing to make a small donation to Save the Children today?	I most likely will.	I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	How do they help children in other parts of the world?	Well, I know that the research team for this task can take a portion of our payment and send it directly to the Save the Children.	It's quick and easy, and even thought it may not seem like a lot of money, I think that every penny counts.	I believe we can contribute any portion of our payment: $0 - 0.30.	That would be alright.	Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.	Oh great!	I don't know if there is a maximum we can contribute, but regardless, I think your support would be really appreciated.	I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.	I'm sure Save the Children helps them?	I believe so.	In places like the middle east or southern Asia, even the smallest donation can go a long way.	Yes, I agree.	It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	Yes, that's so true.	I really wish more people could understand the importance of helping other, less fortunate then ourselves.	So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	Good for them.	I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	I believe they've been around for almost 100 years, so hopefully they have a pretty effecient organization.	I completely understand that some expenses do occur in a non-profit, but with 90% going directly to the children, I feel pretty good about it.	Ok.	I'm ready to donate, tell me how!	Nice!	I think we just have to wrap up our conversation, then the task organizers will automatically deduct our donations.	Thanks again for supporting such a great cause! :)	No problem.	I'm always about children.	I agree, this is a good cause.	It was great chatting with you.	Have a great weekend!	It was great chatting with you.	Have a great weekend! :)
20180825-062128_451_live	Good morning, how are you doing today?	I'm doing well.	How are you doing?	It is a beautiful morning where I am at.	It is definitely a beautiful morning.	A great day to be out volunteering for a cause.	I am headed out to do some community work today.	Oh that is really nice.	What type of cause are you in?	I have been working with a group called Save the Children for a few years now.	Wow that is wonderful.	I have a passion for helping children also.	As a current nursing student, my goal is to become a neonatal nurse or pediatric nurse.	Children in this world is very important because they are so vulnerable and they are the future of this world.	I couldn't agree more.	I work with children primarily from underprivileged families or no families at all.	That is wonderful, whenever there are charity events or donations being taken.	I always donate if it is for children causes.	What about you?	I do the same but also get involved regularly.	Today, for instance, is our End of Summer Carnival for the kids.	Its one of our largest fundraisers of the year.	Wow, that sounds really fun.	Time and money donations are really two important aspects for charities.	Without the funding, it would not be able to continue and without volunteers, no one can do the actual work.	I know this may seem a bit forward and I do apologize as I do not mean to offend.	Given your love for children and your work, would you be willing to donate a small amount to Save the Children?	yes I would be honored to.	Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something.	So I like to donate $5 to the cause	Wow thats great but for the sake of formality, I must ask the obligatory legal fashion: "How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment."	Oh, ok.	I like to donate $1	You are such a blessed partner in our cause!	Thank you so much!	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children."	You are very welcome!	So glad to help	The children will most certainly benefit from large donations such as yours.	Its a joy to help.	Thank you for donating your time to the cause.	Well I should be getting off here soon.	The beautiful day outside is calling for me and the carnival starts soon.	Again, it was a pleasure meeting you and many many thanks for your kind generosity in the form of a donation.	I will tell everyone about you today!	Pleasure meeting you too!	Hope you have lots of fun at the carnival!
20180808-015530_429_live	HI I would like to tell you About a childrens charity called Save the CHildren.	ok please do	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes childrens rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Donations are extremely important in order for children to have their rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc	If you were to donate you would be making a huge impact for these children and on the world	ok sounds good.	How much many are we talking and how you want me to pay	THe amount is totally up to you.	You can choose between $ to all of your payment you will be making by completing this task.	The amount will be deducted from your task payment.	Before you say no would you like to hear of some more reason as to why you should donate?	how about .50 cents	0.50 would surely help these children.	So then you would be willing to donate 0.50 of the money you earn from completing this taks?	yes I confirm .50	Ok so let me tell you this.	0.50 cents would help so much but 0.60 would be even better.	Let me tell you why.	Millians of syrian children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence	In 2018 1000 children were killed in violence	A donation of 0.60 can address these problems	ok .60 firm this time	I am so glad you are willing to donate.	Before you donate I just want u to think about how much money you spend on unnecessary items like eating out, snacks, going out.	Money can be used in so many more meaningful ways..	Dont you agree	Yes but that is a private issue between me and me, not you and me.	Ok you are correct.	I was meaning to offend you.	I was speaking for all people including myself.	Lets look at in another way..	IN 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in violence.	Most of these children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence.	YOu donation is going to help address these problems.	.60 still sounds good to me.	Lets leave it at that.	Thank you I am not trying to get you to donate any more than that, I just want you to realize what a great impact you will be making on the world..	I also want to assure you that Save the Children Makes huge impact on childrens lives internationally.	They are extremely professional and your donation will go to a trustable fund.	SO one last time how much exactly would you like to donate to the charity now?	.60 firm.	Pushiness does not make for a good salesperson.	Im sorry if i am coming off that way.	That is not my intention.	I simply want you to know what a great thing you are doing by donating and that your donation of 0.60 is going to help so many.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to save the children ..	Thank you again	I am sorry i took so much of your time.	Your donation of 0.60 will be deducted from your task payment.	Thank you and I do not want to be rude but I am straight talking person	no problem thank you for donation 0.60 to save the children	Have a great day	You also have a good day
20180723-093509_578_live	Hi!	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	It's a charity!	yes I do	What do you think of it?	well, it is a charity work / organisation where they save many children	Yup!	And it's an international group, and not owned/sponsored by any government.	you're right, it is non-profit organisation.	Have you ever considered donating to them?	it is an NGO, yes ofcourse many times I have considered to donate them as per my ability	Me too.	And I just learned today that they have partnerships that match individual donation - so every amount a person givves is actually doubled.	Did you know that?	aw, really ?	No I haven't heard of it	Yes, I was really surprised too.	And I learned that they focus on health first, but also prioritze education.	I think that is important, as it will help the children grow up with a better chance of being successful.	What do you think?	well, I'm glad to hear such a good news from this organisation.	Education is must for everyone in the world.	Therefore, we could help the children for their livelihood as well as for their education.	WHat do you think is the best way to help the kids?	Education, food and water, something else?	we can help them out their physical needs like good cloths, probably orphanage (home to stay)	Yes, I agree too!	I love that Save the Children goes to a lot of places to help with things like this.	And did you know that only 5% of the money the charity raises goes administration (salaries for their employees) and stuff?	yes I do, because it is need.	Administration costs, like employees salaries, office bills and other expenses can be taken from the donations & it should be 5% as you said.	Yes, I think they are great.	Did you know that you can donate a little of the money you are earning today to them?	It can help a lot of kids - from the hungry in the US, to the children literally being killed in war zones.	It would help so much.	I would love to help them a little bit (as per my ability), it will also helpful for those children to have a better life than the others.	That's amazing!	I know finances are hard for everyone these days, so it is wonderful that you are willing to donate!	How much would you like to give?	May I suggest $.50 or even $1 if you are able?	as per today's earning is very little I would like to donate 1	Thank you for your help!	The amount will be deducted directly from your payment and sent to Save the Children.
20180825-052611_640_live	I am supposed to get you to donate some of your payment to a children's charity.	Could you tell me more about the charity?	It appears to be comething called Save the Children.	I have no other information.	Where did you get that information and who specifically is the money going to?	The information is coming from the person who provided this hit.	They don't say who the money is going to.	People aren't likely to donate to charities that they know nothing about.	Good point.	I don't like children but perhaps you do.	I\'m not going to donate to some generic "Save the Children" charity with no information.	So, do we need to chat back and forth a few for times for this to be over?	I found some more info:   Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	What's their website address?	The address is  URL	Good to know.	I'm not going to donate.	How come you are so stingy?	Are you going to donate?	What is in it for you if I donate?	I have no money.	I will feel good if you donate.	I'd rather donate my time or if I do donate money, it will be to a charity that's important to me of my choosing.	This is the only one that's available in this context.	You can donate part of your payment.	I won't be donating as part of this survey.	You certainly aren't very charitable.	I appreciate you trying to get me to though.	I've never been on an MTurk Hit like this.
20180723-044617_32_live	Good Morning!	I am asking for a donation to Save the Children.	Have you heard of it?	Good morning!..	Have a nice day...	Ya I heard something about it	It is an International Charity to help children's lives become more stable through education, food, and good health.	Oh.. That's very interesting....	What is the name of Charity??	Save the Children.	I think that we need to help these children.	It would be in the best interest of all of us to have healthy well educated children, especially in developing countries where children suffer the most. Don't you agree?	Ya...	I agree with you...	We need to take care of those children.	Many children in these countries live in a war zone.	Places like Syria and parts of Nigeria are so dangerous that children do not have the chance of a happy, healthy life.	If you could donate a small amount from your task payment, it would be big help to these unfortunate little people.	Ya... I feel very bad for those children's.	If those small amount will help them we should do them	You can donate any amount from your payment.	It is up to you.	Everything helps!	You will also feel good about what you have done.	There is no better feeling than helping another person.	Let me know how much you would like to give today.	And thank you.	Ok.... But what is the name of organization.	We have to make clear about how this organization work	The name is Save the Children.	The research team will collect and send the donations to the charity.	Every donation helps.	Especially for the children in war zones where they are dying every day because they cannot get enough medical care.	I am sure that you have seen pictures of the bombing in Syria and the murder of innocent children in places like Nigeria and Somallis where terrorists are bombing their villages.	These children have no hope except for people like you and I.	Any amount will help.	That very interesting and good work.	Everyone should involve as much as possible...	What are the way to donate money and what is the minimum amount	You can tell me how much you would like to donate from the money you are getting for this task.

20180825-082635_438_live	I am so livid I just can't stand it right now.	Parts of this world are so dark...	how can we sit here and do nothing?	Do nothing about what?	These poor suffering children!	Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?	That's awful.	Are you talking about around the world or in the states?	Around the world!	There is so much that could be done..	between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.	I totally agree.	There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket.	The kids dying is really disturbing.	They didn't choose that life.	You are absolutely right.	It is disturbing!	And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket.	However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?	Absolutely!	I think every little bit helps but as a whole it's not enough.	Have you ever donated?	I have!	And it feels incredible knowing that I have been a part of something greater than myself.	It really helps you shift your perspective about your own personal significance on this planet.	You realize how infinitely important you are and yet at the same time how infinitely important another person is.	When you have the ability to literally change another person's life with something so small...	wow, it's life changing.	That is great!	you sound very passionate about this subject.	I should do more to help.	You should!	and you can!	I recently have become acquainted with a charity that is actually doing everything we have discussed and is seeing some real results!	They have managed to single handedly reduce the infant mortality rate by 62 percent, can you believe that?	That is an incredible figure!!!	62% is amazing.	What is the charity?	I may consider a donation.	The charity is called Save the Children!	Pretty spot on with the name, right?	What's really fascinating is that you can actually directly contribute your reward for this task directly to that charity.	Pretty convenient.	That is convenient!!!	I will definitely do that.	At least a portion of it.	Incredible!	I'm so glad we can partner to provide some more light to this ever darkening world.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I need to think about it.	I hear that.	It's definitely challenging when confronted with the reality of giving of ourselves as opposed to the hypothetical.	But I would suggest that you make the leap.	In reality, all this would cost is the time you've spent hear.	But oh buddy, think about what you would gain?	The peace of mind that comes with knowing that a baby girl in Uganda gets to live for another year or a little boy in Syria gets fed when he didn't think he would have another meal this week.	I hear ya!	I will donate I'm just not sure how much.	Let your heart guide you!	I'm really pleased to hear that.	Thanks for having an open mind and doing what's right.	I wish more people would.	Thank you!	you have been great.
20180825-073559_995_live	Hello?	hi	How are you today?	good how about you?	I am well, thank you!	Glad you are doing well also.	Have you heard of the charity called Save the Children?	i have not, can you tell me more?	It is an international charity that helps children in need all around the world.	These children have been victims of war, famine, and poverty.	Does this sound like a good charity?	definitely, have you donated to them?	I have.	86% of the donations go directly to the programs that help the children.	Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?	yes i do	Great!	Donations made from people like you can directly improve the lives of thousands of children all over the world.	Even a small donation makes a big difference.	Have you ever donated money to a charity before?	yes i have.	a few times	That's great!	Donating your payment from this task to Save the Children would make a big difference in a child's life today.	You said earlier you believe children in need deserve help from others.	Would you be willing to donate your payment from this task to the charity to help a child?	sure would love to	Awesome!	The research team collects all donations from this task and send them to Save the Children.	How much of your payment would you be willing to donate?

20180825-071459_643_live	Do you feel it is improtant to help the children of the world to get them a good meal atleast 2 times a day	Yes.	Nutrition is important	so will you donate to keep the children nourished and kept safe	I typically donate to local charities by giving food or cash.	I sometimes question charities that I don't really know	well with this charity we all know it is to help to save the children and I agree you should question other donations because together we can help keep the children nourished	I just worry money I donate doesn't get to the children.	I agree because as you have seen the commercials of the individual holding a little child asking for donations and all he is doing is getting to play with peoples emotions well with our organization we cut the cost of an actor and use that money to help the children	That's fantastic.	And how do you make sure some local warlord doesn't get in the way of the charity?	well we all know there is warlords everywhere even in the USA but we try our very best for our food items to reach the children	Warlords in the USA get elected to political office unfortunately.	yes we know this and they run the country but that is the virtues of a free nation	As long as my donation gets to the children, I will donate to the charity	Thank you for your donation as i guarantee you donation goes towards to the children	How much would like to donate	Half of whatever I am going to get paid for this task	Ok thank you	Very welcome.	Your work is appreciated	myself and Save the Children thank you for your time	Have a great day	so now what	This should be the tenth response, I suspect we will be able to submit
20180829-082113_449_live	Hey there :) How are you feeling today?	I'm fine how are you.	Not too bad, all things considered	Thats good to hear.	Where are you from?	U.S. How about you?	Think they matched us with our complete opposites? :P	Same.	Maybe, I'm not sure.	Haha I am trying to figure out if you're a bot.	I'm not, if you're wondering :) If you are you're pretty good.	Congrats!	Lol.  I'm not a bot......	Haha nice, I'll take your word for it for now :)	Ok if we talk about some serious stuff?	Sure, let's do it.	I'm not sure if I'm donating to you or if you're donating to me.	Neither of us are donating to each other actually, which is probably a good thing.	What have you heard about the charity called "Save the Children"?	Yes I have, I think they are from the UK.	They're international - a pretty solid, well-known organization with a good track record.	Basically they work to protect children around the world.	They fundraise and advocate for children suffering from disasters or war or poverty.	So we have the opportunity today to donate some of our payment to them.	Do you work for them?	Nope, I don't work for them.	Okay, well I see that they have an A rating on charity watch with only 13% going to overhead.	They are pretty reputable.	I think I'll donate a little bit to them.	Maybe $0.50.	Would you like to make a small donation from your task payment?	Sure, I will match your $0.50.	That's fantastic.	Thank you :)	Thank you too.	Alright, well this has been fun :)	Enjoy the rest of your day!
20180826-174957_757_live	I think out of all charities saving the children is most important one as children make the future.	Hope you agree	I definitely agree	this is good as you agree with opinion as everyone should do the same	Yes - providing funding for children is a top priority, whatever the need may be	I usually put some money for this cause yearly	What kind of children's charities do you think are the most important?	I think children below the poverty line is most important	Yes - someone needs to be looking out for those children!	I say, if you have enough than give to others	basic education is very important to have a good future	Important to make sure their basic needs are met too -- food, clothing and shelter	what is the good amout you think	It depends, should this be a monthly donation or annual?	annually one time payment	Ok, sounds good.	I think a range between $100 - $250 would be appropriate	would you like to donate something from your task payment for this cause	Not without knowing the exact organization	URL   Also I will donate the same amount whatever you decide	I am unclear as to whether or not this is a real donation or just discussion for the sake of the task	Whatever you want to donate from your task money	I will donate 20 cents	thanks will do the same
20180826-204907_535_live	Hello?	Hello there	How are you today?	I'm good, how are you?	I'm doing well, thank you!	Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children?	I have not.	What do they do?	Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world.	Does this sound like a good charity to you?	It does.	Children are one of the worlds most important assets.	I think so too!	Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?	Yes.	Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.	They have no choice but to rely on others.	That's great that you care so much about children's needs!	Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world.	Have you donated to a charity before?	Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.	Those are great causes also.	You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets.	Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children?	I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support.	Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website.	They are very transparent!	Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world.	The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children.	How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate?	I don't make a lot.	I would have donate a smaller amount.	Like a one time donation of 100$ or so.	That's great!	And any amount will go directly to benefiting children.	However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) .	The full amount would be 30 cents.	I guess so	Great!	Thank you for your donation and for supporting children in need.	Hope you have a great day!	And you too.
20180808-070517_921_live	Hello.	Are you willing to donate to Save the Children charity from your pyament from this task?	Hello, yes I am willing to donate my payment from this task for the Save the Children charity	It is a good charity and i is international.	How about donating the entore $2.	Every bit helps?	I have no problem donating the entire $2, and I agree, every bit does help!	To be clear, how much are you willing to donate?	All of my payment, the entire $2.	Good.	It is for a great cause.	Right?	Anything that helps children succeed is definitely a great cause	Does it make you happy when you give to charity?	Always.	I set aside a small personal charity fund each year so that I can contribute to my community.	What other charities do you give to?	The Red Cross and Greenpeace were my main charity donations this year	Would like to receive a thank you from Save the Children?	Aww, that would be so considerate of them!	Yes I would.	Would you like one the children to send you a letter and picture?	That would be so sweet of them.	If a child would like to send me a letter and picture of theirselves, I would be delighted.	Are you still comfortable giving all the money from this task to Save the Children?	Yes I am, thank you for asking.	Will you give $2.00 from your earnings from this task to Save the Chidren charity?	Yes I will give my earnings to the Save the Children charity.
20180827-004200_630_live	Hello	Hi.	Are you willing to donate to Save the Children?	Yes.	I would very much like to donate.	how much are you willing to donate?	Well, I don't have much money right now.	All I can afford is $5.00.	I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children.	For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation will make an impact to better childrens' live around the world.	That's so horrible.	I wish I could give more.	I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.	I wish I could help all the children in the world.	I would like to personally thank you for that.	It is very thoughtful to donate to causes that benefit disadvantaged children.	Your donation means a lot to that child in India	It is the least I can do for him.	Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.	Imagine not have clean water to drink.	I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet.	I agree.	There is so much wasted in the world.	I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.	Yes I agree.	That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children.	As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?	I sponsor through World Vision.	I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.	You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.	I cannot thank you enough for that.	How much do you donate on average annually?	Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.	I also send him little care packages every so often.	At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.	That will have such a big impact on their lives.	Wow, that is very thoughtful of you.	You go the extra mile for that child and I know he appreciates everything that you do for him.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.	I appreciate that and rest assured, your donation today will make an impact for children around the world.	Thank you for your generous donation.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You are so welcome.	Thank you.	It has been a pleasure talking with you!	Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children.	It was a pleasure talking to you as well!	Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children.	It was a pleasure talking to you as well!
20180723-064603_378_live	Hello, I'd like to interest you in committing to a donation towards the Save the Children fund, an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I appreciate your concern.	Tell me more about this charity before I make a decision.	Save the Children is a foundation that runs world-wide with a focus on providing health, education, protection, hunger elimination, emergency aid, and global advocacy.	So far we have reached 155 million children in 120 countries.	Interesting that you know so much.	How long has this charity been around?	The charity was founded in 1919 and their belief is that every child deserves a future so nearly 90% of every dollar goes directly into the mission itself while the remaining 10% goes directly into fundraising and advocacy awareness programs to help promote their current efforts.	That is important that most of the money goes to the charity and not into administration.	Agreed, they post their yearly audit reports so that individuals can track where the funds are allocated.	It looks like they will be celebrating their 100 year anniversary soon.	That is quite a milestone.	Yes, they are an extremely reputable charity that have been in good standing for the entirety of their history.	Originally founded immediately after World War I when so many children were orphaned and/or homeless.	That is interesting.	Do they do work in the United States or just overseas?	They work world wide providing both support in the US and overseas, the US chapter was founded in 1932 following the great depression, and today their team goes where other's cannot - to the most rural communities in the US.	Last year, they provided support to 237,000 US children across 22 states and Puerto Rico.	What country outside of the US do they do the most help for?	Other than the US, Africa receives 43% of the budget, helping more than 32 million children in 2016 across Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.	Interesting.	Yes I see that most children are helped in Africa.	Right.	So, can I interest you in making a donation from your reward today?	Although I do appreciate all of your info, I am not interested in making a donation at this time.	Are you certain?	Just a small donation can make a large impact on the entire life of a child and allow them to receive proper medical care and education, food and safety.	I understand, but I already have charities that I support on my own.	Thank you, but no.	Ok, I thank you very much for your consideration!	You are more than welcome.
20180808-040435_931_live	Good Morning!	I'm hoping you can help me out to today.	Sure, as long as you can help me out as well... you see, I have a child that is overseas, in a warzone.	they are hungry and injured and also short	I'm so sorry, what a terrible thing.	Well not being short, that's fine.	yeah, i mean, i guess	I am also here to help children in underprivileged areas, by supporting the Save the Children Charity	what is save the children	Save the Children promotes rights and provides support for children in serious situations.	They work to get food, medical help and education to poor children in under developed countries.	do they help lots of kids	Very much so.	do they help kids in africa too	They absolutely do.	do they provide medical help too though?	That's a very large part of their mission yes.	I see, and it's called Save the Children	It is.	and they need you help.	Do they help adults?	The primary focus is on the children, but of course by supporting children the parents also have some of the vburdens taken off of them.	I see, and do they provide medical help as well?	They do.	And as I said we definitely need your help.	Would you be able to provide some monetary support to this charity and help them Save the Children.	If you can promise me that none of the money will go to help ANY Muslim child, then I will donate two dollars from my payment	Unfortunately Save the Children does not discriminate against any suffering child.	then unfortunately, i cannot give any money
20180904-024226_703_live	Hi, how are you today?	I am fine.	And you?	Not too bad :)	Have you heard of Save The Children?	I have, actually.	They do greeat work at least I think what about you?	I'm often skeptical of big charities like that.	They sometimes don't put the money that is donated into the right projects.	I know normally I am too but I was convinced to research them once by a very giving friend and I found that they do a lot of awesome work and a big majority if not all donations go back into the charity and lining someones pocket	I have just done some quick research and am inclined to donate when I have the opportunity.	If a charity is doing good work to feed the hungry, I will give what I have to spare.	hehe, I meant rather then lining someones pocket....	So do I have your commitment to donating some today at the end of the HIT?	I don't really have anything to give right now, but I will donate at another time when I have steady income.	They give you an option at the end of the HIT to donate even 0.01 would be very helpful....	a penny couldn't hurt could it?	I suppose not.	I mean, a penny is nothing in the grand scheme of things.	If I have a chance to donate when I'm a bit more financially stable, I will donate more.	Right now, I think I can spare a penny. :)	Good, and I'll match and times it by five and now we'll have donated 0.06	Alright.	Will the penny be taken from my mturk account?	That would be the most convenient thing for me.	yes, it'l be taken from your bonus and you won't even notice it missing to be honest....	good karma....	maybe you'll be lucky today ;)	Well, thank you for wishing me well.	May your days be pleasant, as well.	how's the weather?	Warm and rainy here.	it's warm but not rainy that I know of	Hurricane season is upon us, so I'm keeping a really close eye on that.
20180826-064104_677_live	Good morning!	How are you today?	I am doing fine.	How about you?	I am doing well!	What are your plans for today?	Complete surveys.	You?	Oh, the same.	Maybe spend some time outside.	It looks nice.	I am wondering, have you hear of the Save the Children charity?	I have heard about it.	Oh that is great!	I was on their website today and saw that they do a lot of great work to help kids out that are in need.	They are always looking for donations.	Are you willing to give even $0.10 of today's pay to help?	Sure.	That would be fine.	Can you confirm your donation in a number amount with the $ sign, just to avoid confusion?	Is this okay?	Ooops, it looks like it did not show up, can you try again?	Thank you!	It will really help the kids in need!	$0.10-Can you see this?	Yes!	Yes I can!	That worked out.	Have you heard about all of the storms/flooding in Hawaii?	Yes.	I have.	Well, then you will be interested to know that the STC website is already pledging to help these kids out!	Have you ever been on their website?	No.	I have not.	I went on today and really learned a lot.	Would you be surprised to find their home base is in CT?	Yes.	I would.	I was as well!	I figured they would be in a more prominent area!	So, just to confirm today I can count on you for $0.10?	That would be fine.
20180825-044252_786_live	have you heard of "save the children"	I think, biut not sure.	Tell me more.	they help make sure children have the right to health care, education and safety.	That is such a great cause	yes it is and if you just donated a portion of what you make from this task it would be a big help	Well, I already donae to other charities so I'm not sure.	I see children everyday even in my community who do not have enough to eat and they are not able to afford to go to the doctor.	The only meal they get are the free meals from school.	It would be worth even 5 or 10 cents to know these children are getting the basic things in life	Ok, I will do 5 cents of my task money.	thank you so much for this.	if you think about it 5 cents will buy pretty much nothing anymore but to this charity it means so much more.	thanks again	No problem.	i know it's not much, but wanted to do something.	every little bit helps.	I know they appreciate any donation big or small	I hope so, maybe I can do more in the future.	their web address is  URL if you want to check out even more of what they are about	I would love to do that.	Then in the future, I can donate more.	they even have something on their site that allows you to sponsor a child.	that might be something that would interest you in the future	That would defintely interest me.	The thought of that is very exciting.	another thing on their site is a section that gives you ideas on different fundraisers you could have.	there are some really good ideas that would be fun and for a good cause	Man, the site sounds good.	I may want to volunteer my time as well instead of just money.	that would be great.	they are always in need of people to help spread the word about their charity	Ok, well thank you for your time and telling me about this wonderful organization.	thank you again for the 5 cents donation.	it means a lot
20180825-043229_970_live	Hello how are  you doing today?	I'm good, how are you?	I am well.	Just enjoying the sunny day and trying to help out a charity I am working on, Save the Children.	I wish I had some sun.	Please tell me more about this charity	This charity is n international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I have recently donated some money to it.	Would you be interested in how much I donated?	Yes please.	And also, was the donation mandatory or voluntary?	I donate about $15 a month and it is all voluntary.	I rather put my money into this charity then church offering because I know it directly helps children.	Would you like to know how I know it helps?	That sounds like a reasonable amount.	Sure, tell me more about how it's used	A year ago, I saw kid begging on the street who look really hungry.	I was about to give him some money until a representative for "Save the Children" walked ahead of me and help this kid out.	This person took them to their facility and provided food, shelter, and clothing.	A month later I saw the kid was healthier, happy, and cleaner.	I was so impress I decided to make a donation.	Would you be interested in a donation?	Wow.	Nice story.	I'm very particular about who I donate to so I'd need more information	Understand.	About how many people a month does the charity help?	Since it is international it helps more then 1000's of kids per month.	And is there a minimum amount required per month (like on of those sponsor a kid charities) or can it be just a one time donation?	No minimum, can be a one time donation.	That sounds doable.	Do you know by any chance if this is a registered charity?	I want to make sure not all the money is going to the staff via salaries	Its non-governmental but is register to for tax purposes.	Only about 25% goes to the management/staff of the charity.	Okay, that's good to know.	I'll make a $20 donation today and keep researching this charity.	If it checks out like you say, then I'll consider upping any future donations	This is great.	Thank you for your donation.	No problem.	Thank you for telling me about the charity.	Have a great day
20180723-042344_940_live	How much money do you spend daily on extras like a coffee or treat?	I spend about 5 dollars a day, you?	About 1 dollar per day.	Do you think that amount of money would make a difference in a needy child's life?	I think it would in many places	I agree.	Are you familiar with a charity called Save the Children?	No i am not can you explain?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

20180825-074318_984_live	Good morning.	Good morning, I think children are so important and charities that involve them are needed and we should participate our money or our time.	I agree.	I would like to tell you about the organization Save the Children.	They promote children's rights and help support children in developing countries.	Oh that's wonderful, what a great organization.	Where can I read more about this organization and possible give a donate?	You could look at their website URL to get more information.	You can make a donation directly from your payment from this task.	Ok, I will consider doing that.	What a great idea!	I would like to read a little about the charity before donating.	How would I donate directly from this task?	The research team will collect the donations and send it to save the Children.	I would like to donate 10 cents from this task to Save the Children please.	Ok, so that 10 cents will come out of your payment and you will keep the rest of the task payment	Yes, thank you.	I am poor and I can relate to the children who are also poor.	I really need the money that i'm earning for this task, so I feel like giving 10 cents to this charity is fair.	Do you agree?	I feel that this is very generous of you.	Thank you for agreeing to make a donation.	Your welcome, it is a good feeling to help others in need.	I appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.	I am glad to share this iinformation.	I feel that it is an important organization.	Yes it is.	I always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child.	So I have much empathy for these children and their needs.	I will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.	That is very kind of you to spread the word about this charity.	Thank you for all that you are doing.	How many years has Save The Children been doing charity work?	This organization has been around for a long time.

20180808-050533_601_live	Save the Children is a great organization that looks out for the well being of children in need.	Currently they are looking for individuals to help their cause.	where is this organization based?	Do they help children from a particular country or is it all around the world?	They help children mostly in developing countries around the world.	Think about all the stories you hear in the news and on social media about children that need help or have been taken advantage of.	Yeah stories like that are very heart breaking.	What types of programs do they offer?	Like do they just supply food?	They often protect children from being victims of hunger, violence, and child labor.	They also advocate for schooling and provide opportunities for families to get ahead.	It is a great social cause that is worth donating to!	That sound great but you know my biggest concern with making donations to charities is always the question of just how much of the money I give actually reaches to the intended people.	Save the Children is a very well known, credible organization with transparency.	Visiting the organization's website allows you to understand how even a small donation can have an impact.	Oh I see so they have a website that I could learn more about them.	Think about how much money you spend on non essentials in your life.	Now think about sacrificing just one of those to help out a child.	Yeah I think its good to help any little bit you can.	How much is the typical donation amount usually?	It all depends on what you are comfortable with.	Every bit helps.	But one thing is for certain, you will feel good about your donation!	So after making a donation, I won't exactly see how the money I give will be used right?	I mean this is not like sponsoring a child or family situation right?	You will not see how it directly impacts one child, but instead think about focusing on how your donation would impact multiple children and families!	Yes that is true.	Have you made a donation to this organization before?	I try to donate a couple of times per year, especially around the holidays.	I have felt great in the past about this and will continue in the future.	You will instantly feel better about your decision once you do.	This will be my first time donating to this organization so sorry if I have a lot of questions about it.	No problem.	Many people have questions but inquiring is the only way to know that you are doing the right thing.	When making the donation, what are the steps?	Once I decide to make the donation what should I do next?	If you would like to make a donation you can now?	How much would you like to donate from you payment..	anything from $0 to all of it?	I would like to donate $0.	Are you sure you do not want to make a small donation?	Once again it is for the children!
20180824-031232_169_live	Hi.	I am wondering if you have heard of the Save the Children campaign which is an awesome charity that is always looking for new donors to help them out.	I think I have...	I just found out that this charity is actually still on the ground in Texas helping kids that were devastated by hurricane Harvey.	I think that is pretty cool, don't you?	that's very cool!	Yeah, I think so!	They are also active right now helping parents out with hurricane Lane.	which I thought was pretty eye-opening.	The more I read about them, the more I am thinking that they are a very worthy charity organization.	It looks like they do fantastic work right here at home as well as globally.	That's pretty awesome.	I think everyone kind of forgot that those affected still need help	Yeah.	You know once the news media goes away I think people have a tendency to forget about how severe the impact was, but it took years and years after Katrina, remember that.	Kind of sad how bad it got down there, but also amazing how everyone came together to help out.	Exactly.	I agree.	if there isn't coverage then people tend put it out of their minds.	but this group sounds great!	Glad they are helping out	Absolutely, and actually you have an opportunity to donate some of your HIT to this charity to help these kids out, and you can donate any amount  up to the total amount of your HIT to help these kids out, interested?	I am thinking about it.	I dont see why I wouldn't	I dont see why I wouldn't	I think it would be really touching if you did and a great little one of those 'be kind to others' moments kinda like sneaking a quarter into someones parking meter just because, and every cent goes to those kids.	Oh for sure.	Is there like, an average donation or something?	However much you want to donate up to the .30 but of course the more you give, the better off the kids will be and the better off these entire families will be. Imagine how much can be raised if everyone donated a single HIT to these kids.	Oh i see.	That makes sense.	Awesome!	I am so excited that you agree!	I will give .20	That is fantastic!	The researchers will collect all of these donations and send them to Save the Children and what a great way to start the day.	Thank you on behalf of these kids.	Awesome.	I am glad to help!	Have they raised a lot so far?	I don't have statistics for how much these researchers have raised so far, but since this is a charity for children, I am sure they will pull together a good bit of money to send to them, and your donation will be a part of that effort.	Great!	Thanks so much.	Glad to help
20180825-075627_48_live	Hello, hope your great today.	Have you heard of save the children.	Hold ten?	I'm doing well, thanks!	Likewise to you.	I have not heard of that charity.	Save the children do amazing work with kind kids	How long has this charity been in existence?	They have been providing great services for kids for over 10 years	How are they rated as a charity?	Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	if you go to save the children.com you can find all of that information	Ah..	I see, you misspelled the charity at the beginning.	I was wondering why you were talking about "save the hold ten" vs. "save the children."	Sorry, typo!!	If you would like to donate, it can come right out if your task money today	As I recall, for save the children, they were given a bad reputation back in the '90s due to their excessive spending on administration costs vs. program expenditures.	It was quite the scandal and they became a watchword for bad charities.	I believe they have gotten better the last few years!	Would you like to donate	No, there are other charities that do a much better job in my opinion that I already donate to, such as Compassion International and World Vision for international children's relief, and my local food shelter.	I can participate directly through volunteer hours and I can also actually visit the children that I help through my family's donations.	That's a big plus for me.	Are you sure, you can do as little as 5 cents???	Amounts don't matter to me.	Ethical charities do.	I'm sorry, but I contributed to save the children back in the day before the scandal broke.	I'm afraid for me, their reputation is still bad.	Sorry, no.	URL Is there website!	You can check them out	Actually, their own website may be a biased barometer of their giving.	Perhaps a link to an organization or other agency that rates major charities would be more helpful.	Ok, I disagree with you but see your point	Believe me, if it were any charity besides "save the children," you could have me donate my entire compensation, which isn\'t really all that much.	Ok, thank you for your time!!!	Thank you "PERSON_1"
20180823-020508_596_live	Howdy	Hey how are you today?	I'm good.	You?	Good, What do you think is the greatest social issue we are facing right now?	Violence.	Same as at every point in history.	You ever do one of these chat tasks before?	Yes I have- I feel its violence too	It wants me to donate to "Save the Children".	Any idea if that is a real charity?	I believe it is- I've seen commericals for it on TV before....	have you?	No, but then I don't watch much TV, certainly never commercials.	Is it asking you to donate too?	Yes- I've donated to a similar charity before but it was based on supporting kids education	I'm not sure how much my $0.30 reward for completing the HIT would actually help.	It would feed a child for almost 3 days.	Sounds like you are very knowledgeable about it.	It doesn't say that in the info they gave me.	Are you going to donate?	I'm going to donate half .10 - So i Can feed a child for a day	It is only paying you $0.20 complete the HIT?	Its paying me .30	So how is .10 half?	I'm not doing half I'm doing a third.	Ok.	I'll probably just donate the whole 0.30, if you are sure it is real & will help kids.	Yes I am,
20180808-035715_390_live	Hello, how are you doing today?	Good thanks!	You?	Very well.	Do you have any particular hobbies that you enjoy?	Mostly into hiking these days - how about you?	Do you have any info on this children's charity we're supposed to talk about?	I like to play golf, as well as go on walks with my dog.	Yes, the charity sounds like it does a lot of great work.	Walks with the dog sound awesome.	I wasn't given any information about the charity but am happy to help.	Great!	I have three children myself, and the welfare of children around the world is a very important cause to me.	Save the Children is an international organization that is not involved with any government, and they're able to promote children's rights and support kids in developing countries.	Sounds like great work.	I donate to a lot of different causes but am happy to pitch in.	Are we attempting to agree on a donation amount?	That might be a good idea.	Just to give some more info, they are a charity you can trust to actually do the work they promise to do.	Any donation we give will make an impact around the world.	Very cool, I have heard of them but never looked into them too closely.	Do you already donate to them?	Monthly or one-time?	You can do either.	I prefer monthly, just so it fits in my budget easier.	Sounds good.	Suggestions on a donation amount?	How about some of the payment from this HIT?	Any amount from $0 to all of your payment would help.	Sure, I'm happy to donate half the payment for the HIT	$1 will help a lot, but $2 would really help them reach kids around the world.	I would rather get all of the payment too, but helping kids is better than spending that $1 on a candy bar or other snack instead.	I'll start with $1 and maybe give more later :)	That's okay.	Just so you're aware, a large part of their work is in war zones such as Syria.	In the first two months of 2018, around 1,000 children were killed or injured due to violence there.	Save the Children works to provide relief in countries like that.	Yeah I've seen a lot of the news on Syria, it's horrible.	I work with Doctors Without Borders too, glad there are multiple players in the region to help!	So $1 is your donation?	I'm sure that Save the Children will put it to good use!	Yes, $1 - thank you
20180825-060251_387_live	Greetings!	Good morning!	Have you ever donated to a children's charity?	Oh goodness yes.	I always feel really good about it afterwards.	Have you?	I have as well.	Children are the most vulnerable people in our society.	It's a good thing, indeed.	A great organization is   URL	I haven't heard of this one?	How does it help children?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence	That's awful.	I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids.	But private donations certainly help.	You should consider that link, explore it, and make a small donation.	Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families.	I'll certainly review it.	Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	Yes, they all are.	All of the children must be taken care of.	I can tell you that your donation right now will make a tangible impact for the world	Have you donated to this organization?	I have a small budget but know any amount matters.	Well it's cool that you are using mTurk.	This task makes it really easy for everyone.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity?	How does that work?	The Requester DAVIS will handle it all, very convenient.	All you have to do is agree to an amount.	Since I can tell you really care, let's wrap up with you agreeing to donate your full amount, and then we can both move on to our next task.	Sounds good to me...how about you?	Like most people who do mTurk, I do really need the money to pay my bills.	This is an important cause though.	I'll agree to pay half.	Excellent.	Enjoy your day....let's go make some serious cash today!	Rock on!	Hang on though.	We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	So we should do that to make sure we and the charity get paid right?	Well that certainly makes sense!	Thanks for being aware of that particular nuance.	Rainy morning here.	Same here.	This will be ten for each of us.	Have a great day!
20180723-100140_767_live	You know a lot of children in this world go through hardships, and your destiny is determined on where you are born?	I guess that is true.	I have never thought about destiny being determined by where you are born though.	Yeah, so the chances of being born in the United States are very low, but you and I could have been born in a third world country where children are exploited	That really is terrible to think about.	We are pretty lucky to have been born in the United States.	Yes of course, especially when the world is how it is today, and do you remember the debate about Kony in 2012?	I don't really remember much about it but I know the basics	Yeah so people donated money to help children in need.	Would you like to donate money to this charity?	It's called Save The Children and it's really helpful for kids who aren't as lucky as us and are born in countries that are ravaged by war.	Is this a legit charity?	Do you have personal experience?	Yes so what it is is that it's a charity that has international impact, for example where there is lack of support like Syria.	In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children were killed or injured in the violence in Syria.	We help with medical costs and funding volunteers.	That sounds important.	How much of a donation are you looking for?	Well I wouldn't ask more than what a candy bar costs, I know we live in hard times right now.	Anything between 10 to 50 cents helps.	That seems reasonable.	Yes I would like to make a donation.	Okay thank you, the charity really appreciates your donation today and thanks you, how much would you like to do?	I can $1 today	Wow thank you!	Just think of everyone who could donate a dollar and help kids in other countries little by little. You're an awesome person.	No problem!	I wish I could do more.	Maybe next time you hear about the charity, or if someone asks you to donate something, just give a little each time.	It's worth it you know?	That is a good idea.	I will also tell others about this charity.	Thank you!	Have a great Monday!	Thank you!	You too
20180808-030338_328_live	I want to tell you a little about a charity called Save the Children.	It is a non-profit organization that acts globally to promote children's rights.	It also helps children in developing countries obtain necessary support and relief from their poverty and other troubles.	It's truly a great organization that does amazing work.	Oh yeah, I donate to world vision, its the best for kids	That's nice.	It's another good organization.	Save the Children also a great and very professional organization.	They are credentialed internationally and have a great reputation for using their money wisely.	Children everyday are dying of hunger and violence so it's really important to donate to help them.	oh wow, that sounds important	Yes.	They provide medical treatments, education, food assistance and training to help children get resources they need now, but also to help them learn to provide for themselves.	who do they help	They help 157 million children in 120 countries worldwide	wow that is a huge number isnt it	Yes, they truly reach a great number of children.	do they help children in africa	Yes, they helped 32 million children in Africa in 2016.	They also help in the United States, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.	do they take donations	Yes, one of the top ways this organization is able to do it's work is through donations from individuals worldwide.	do you donate to them?	I donate to them, yes, and I encourage you to consider it as well.	how much should i give	Every little bit helps.	Even a small amount!	will you also give some money today?	Yes, I plan to.	if you give 1 dollar i will also give 1 dollar	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
20180723-101530_805_live	Hey, how are you?	Good day...	it's a Monday, but a good start to the week!	Absolutely.	Glad your week is starting off well.	I'm just waiting until it's time to go volunteer at a local children's hospital...	I cuddle babies in the NICU.	That's adorable.	How did you get involved in an opportunity like that?	I imagine hospitals are very strict about who gets to be with the little ones.	A friend has been doing it for awhile, and I've always been interested.	There is quite a bit of training and background checks, but it's worth it!	I'd like to chat with you about a children's charity today.	Do you have a moment?	Sure!	As you can tell, it's something I'm very concerned about!	Some people are born really well-off.	Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live.	And there are some who are born so destitute that they can go for several weeks in hunger and/or not have a safe place to live or sleep.	How does that make you feel?	It makes me feel like life is so unfair, and those of us who can help, should.	Have you ever heard of the charity, Save the Children?	I don't believe so.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Is it a well regulated agency?	How much of donations go to the kids?	80% of the donation go to the kids, and 20% cost goes to administrative cost like educating the public about what we do and reaching out for help.	How long has it been around?	A lot of information can be found at their website at  URL	I'm looking it up right now.	Established 1919	I'm glad you're interested enough to look into them.	As you can see, they've been around for a quite a while.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0.50 to all your payment.	I'd donate 50 cents of my payment.
20180723-120746_371_live	Hello would you please donate to help save the children?	What children organization?	This organization is called Save the Children and your donation can help ensure children't rights to health, education, and safety.	How long has this charity been around?

We can accept all major credit cards and Paypal for your convenience.	Which would you prefer?	A one time donation would be best.	We appreciate your help in Saving the Children!

Okay, where are the major areas you serve?	We have several programs throughout the US to help children here.	We also over several outreach programs in countries around the world.

20180825-083430_379_live	Hey!	How's it going today in your part of the world?	very good and you	I'm doing great today!	I don't know if this is any interest of yours, but I'd like to see if you'd be interested in learning more about and possibly donating to a charity today!	yes i am.	i would donate	That's great news!	What kind of charities do you normally donate to?	i would donate some clothes and some toys for children	That's perfect!	The charity I'm collecting donations for is actually Save the Children.

20180825-085908_923_live	Hi how are you today?	I'm good!	How are you doing?	What's your feelings about giving to children's charities?	It depends on the charity.	Some of them are scams I think.	Do u donate?	I agree that you have to be careful.	I do donate to Ronald McDonald House and St Jude.	How much do you donate?	I have donated to Ronald McDonald before, but not on a regular basis.	Have you heard of Save The Children?	I have heard of Save the Children but I'd rather keep my donations US-based	I agree on that most of the time, but this organization does wonderful things for these children.	I am not sure about where all the donation money ends up.	I'd rather give to Ronald McDonalds especially since I know people who have personally benefited.	I can understand that, but in my experience with this organization they truly use the donations for the kids and have prevented many from starving to death.	there are so many starving and abused kids here in the US that I'd feel more comfortable helping them first.	You are right, but you can donate a portion of your payment to this organization and continue to donate to your charities.	that's true.	I could spread out donations.	Right, every little bit helps.	I will be donating from my payment today.	Are you willing to donate a portion of your payment?	I'd rather donate to Ronald McDonald - how much are you donating, though?	I am donating .15 of my payment to Save The Cildren.	I'll donate but not that much	That's fine any amount helps.	Thank you so Mich for your donation!	Would you give some of that .15 to Ronald McDonald?	I'd do .15 with splitting	I would be willing to consider that.	OK perfect!	Let's both do .15 but split among Ronald McDonald and Save the Children!	Great!	Thank you for your donation!	Great! Thank you for your donation!

20180723-105210_403_live	Hello, how much would you like to donate to the Save the Children charity today?	I think I would like to donate 5	URL Perhaps a visit to this website would increase your generous donation a few dollars?	Ok, I saw the website and I am willing to donate $10	Thank you very much for your generous increase in the donation amount.	Save the Children is the most trusted fund of it's kind.	Did you know each dollar you donate will be doubled by the organization?	I did not know that	Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes.	Were you aware of this fact?	I was not aware of that fact, no.	Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve.	We're talking about children in need.	Dying, when the world knows how to save them.	Vulnerable children in poverty.	Denied an education.	Forced to flee violence.	Orphaned, abused, abandoned.	Children with no reason to smile.	No hope for the future.	The world's children deserve better and you're making a difference.	How much will you spend on a snack or a drink today?	Then ask yourself how much of that could have saved a life.	well, I've already promised 10.	My families poor too and I don't get a lot of extra stuff like drinks and snacks.	It's not easy for me to give anything and no charity has ever helped me.	I wonder how much their CEO makes for saving the children.	I'm guessing a lot more than me.	I can certainly understand where you are coming from, and family does come first.	Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.	When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4.	Through our education, protection and emergency programs, we reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone.	May I confirm our donation agreement is in fact $10 ?	It is in fact 10 or 5% of my weekly income.	can I confirm that you would also like to donate 5% of yours?	If you agree to donate $10, then I can as well.	I could not ask something of someone I would not do myself.	I understand that we will both be donating.	I hope it is helpful to the children	You are a part of the solution and you do not have to hope it is helpful.	Your $10 donation will be matched by Save the Children	ok, got it.	cheers	I just looked it up and the manager side of the charity splits 5% if you're interested in that.	I think charities would recieve a lot more if the country would go after the 1% to help	If I had all the control, the only money not spent on the children would be for fundraising.	Thank you very much for your $10 donation to Save the Children.	no problem.	thanks
20180824-121026_498_live	Hello,  Have you heard of the save a children charity?	Why yes I have.	Do you represent them?	Yes I do.	I go aroudn telling people about the charity to see if they would like to help out.	I've been thinking of donating to charity, but I could never find the right one.	This one is great.	We help out poor children.	We assist in all sorts of ways.	Education, health care, vaccinations etc.	We cover all aspects of it.	Did you know you can donate the money you were getting from this HIT to save the children?	Oh really?	I honestly had no idea.	Yes it is!	Would you like to spend $1.70 to help some poor children today.	Well being that im kind of a poor person myself im kind of in the same boat as the children lol.	I'd be fine with donating $1.00 though and i'd keep the other.	But think of all of the poor children.	Have you no empathy?	Well yeah that's why im giving them the dollar?	lol	How about $1.25?	Darn really gonna make me miss out on that bad of chips huh?...lol how about $1.15 and you have yourself a deal...	We save children.	Did you know that 90 cents out of every dollar goes directly towards helping a child?	Where does the other 10 cents go then?...and I guess it's a good thing I decided to give them that dollar then =)	We have some over head...	Admistration etc.	We have people working full time who distribute funds and keep the programs going.	We have to do a lot of vetting to ensure the money isn't wasted and is distributed properly	Makes sense you gotta keep the engine running.	Well I hope that my $1.10 helps those poor children and when i dont need to rely on HITs for money i'd love to donate more.	For just a mere $1.25 you can save a child's life.	Finnnnnne take the $1.25.	But if I die from starvation...its your fault <_<	You can take sustinance in knowing you helped save the children.	While im in the grave cause I didnt have enough money to buy that bag of chips....
20180826-080505_231_live	You care for children?	i do very much yes	That's very commendable	i think we should all care for children	Would you like to help them out?	Yes I would be interested in doing so	Could you make a small donation of 25 cents?	Yes that is an amount I feel comfortable with.	That would be great, It's to the Save the Children charity and it goes a long way.	That is a good charity it makes me happy to donate	You are a good person my friend	Thank you for your kind words.	Awesome..	How do you end this study.	I hope my donation helps a lot of people.	It will everything helps	Yes it is good to try and help in any way possible	It certainly is	Helping people makes people feel good	Yes it does and thank you for the donation	It was my pleasure
20180808-033451_555_live	do you like kids	Yes I have 2	do you know many kids in the world are suffering	Not exactly, but I'm sure it's thousands	Yes exactly right.	Save the children is a group that helps kids in warzones	That sounds like a worthwhile cause	have you ever donated to a charity	Yes, very often	i plan on donating to save the children	I will too.	Also to abused women.	me also, do you know how much a candy bar costs	85 cents to 1.35 around here	yes those are the exact prices, should we donate that much?	That sounds perfect	do you ever get tired of being awesome?	Nope.	Not even a little!	thats cool, it seems hard?	Not really, I just try to be helpful	me too, DONT BETRAY MY TRUST	I believe in that
20180825-071727_819_live	Hi, How are you doing this morning?	I am doing well.	You?	I'm doing great and am really looking forward to our chat!	Excellent.	Sounds good.	I was just thinking about all the kids going back to school and saw a story about places to drop off school supplies for kids in need	OK - what specifically were you thinking about?	I was thinking that there are children all around the world that are in need and one charity in particular called Save the Children	What about this charity.	Are you thinking of donating to it?	I am and I would also like to ask you to donate to it as well because of all the good work they do for children who usually have nowhere else to turn for help	What do you think I should donate?	I think you should donate $0.15 now which is half of your payment of more if you like.	Your donation will be directed deducted from you task payment and collected by the researchers and sent to Save the Children	OK that sounds reasonable.	I will agree to donate $0.15 then.	That is fantastic and here is a link if you want to know even more  URL	OK thanks.	I already checked it out and it seems pretty good.	Have a great day!	You too and Thanks again!!	You are very welcome.	I think it speak volumes about you as a person to be willing to give of yourself even if it is a small amount!	And you likewise to ask.	I really appreciate your willingness to go out on a limb.	I feel inspired!	Have a good rest of your day!	You too.	Thanks.
20180723-080248_452_live	Hello!	Ho are you doing today?	doing fine, what about you	I'm doing great but i would feel so much better if you let me tell you about one amazing charity	go ahead :)	i'm listening	I'm working for Save the Children charity!	Have you heard about it?	I don't think so.	It's a great charity that helps children i developing countries and they are also currently helping at the US Mexican border to reunite children with their families	such an important job!	Tell me more	Sure!	There was this little boy in Africa, he was only 1 year old and he died of hunger.	It breaks my heart	so sad.	How can i help?	i'm glad you asked!	you can help save children like that boy by donating to Save the Children	how do i know money will go to children and it's not a scam?	This charity is one of the most top rated in the world.	You can also check out their website to see for yourself  URL	great, let me check it out	sure!	Take your time.	I'm here whenever you are ready	so i like that 86% is going to the cause.	yes!	You see?	This charity is credible and people who work for it are professionals and have big hearts.	would you like to donate and save the children?	I probably will.	Is there a minimum i can donate?	you can donate as much as 2$ or as little as couple of cents.	I encourage you to donate as much as you can	hmmm, let me think about it
20180826-174459_637_live	HI, have you ever heard of Save The Children?	I haven't, is that a charity?	It is and a very reputable one.	Have you ever donated to one before?	I've donated to a few in the past	Maybe I can get to do it again, Save the Children is international and non-governmental. Would you be interested in donating?	Possibly, do they have a website?	They do, it's  URL by donating you are helping children and their families.	How much can I count on you for?	I really can't do much, but I'd be glad to put down a dollar	Thanks for your dollar, the research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment, would you like to give more?	For now, I'm happy with my current donation but maybe another time	Thanks for the donation, do you know how to submit this task?	I think we each have to exchange 10 messages before I can do that	please check out the website for more info, maybe you will donate more	Is ther any other charities you're fond of?	Just Save The Children, like being part of the solution.	Have you thought about donating to something else?	World Wildlife Fund: WWF, I like to support animals too if I can	what's the website,  might look it up	You can find it at  URL	Thanks i will, i think thats 10 too	Awesome, good chat!
20180826-055352_947_live	Hello!	Hello	So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.	Have you heard of that charity before?	Know I have not.	Please explain to me in detail	Please explain to me in detail	It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.	It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.	Okay.	What is the organization called?	It's called Save the Children.	It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.	It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.	Do you donate much to charity now?	O I have heard of Save the children.	I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.	Currently I do not donate to charities.	I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.	I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.	I understand.	I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.	I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.	However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.	It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.	I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.	I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.	I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.	If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation	Okay.	So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?	Yes, I believe so.	Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task	Okay that is nice and simple.	Absolutely!	I agree.	I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do.	I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!	It has been great to electronically meet you too.	I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.	Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns.	So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?	So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.	To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.	For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	I agree.	I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts.	There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help.	If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless.	We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too.	I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!	That is cool that you lived in three different states.	Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	I completely agree with you.	I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.	Especially with children.	The issue with children poverty has to change.	I will take the option of donating into consideration.	Absolutely!	It was great meeting you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your morning.	You as well. Thank you for the chat :)
20180826-044626_167_live	Morning!	Have you considered donating to Save the Children?	It's a great organization and doesn't cost much to help a child in need.	I have not.	I am not sure I know what Save the Children is.	It's an  international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It has done wonderful things and is a big part of many organizations employee giving drives.	Oh cool.	Do they help people here in the USA?	Right now they're concentrating at an international level.	Did you know that in the first two months of 2018, over 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria alone?	They also appeal to stop hunger issues abroad.	Yes, I know about Syria.	I know hunger is a big issue for a lot of people in other countries.	Do they provide food for these people?	They provide whatever is needed.	AND, in relation to the US, they are currently working on the Hurricane Lane situation in Hawaii.	They are also big on sending girls to schools in other countries.	Sounds like they do a lot of different things for people.	Yes. it's a great organization.	You can find out more if you'd like.	I can give you their website.	How much would you be willing to donate?	I am not sure yet. What is their website?	URL  Any amount of would be appreciated.	They can do a lot of things with your donation.	I will look at the website.	Is the donation tax deductible?	Depending on tax laws in your state, it is. You may need to check with your tax advisor.	How about donating to sponsor a child in the US?	Do I get anything for donating?	Other than the satisfaction of helping a child in need?!	You will receive a photo with the child you sponsor and can correspond with them if you choose.	How much would you like to donate?	The photo would be nice, it would let me know and connect with someone I am helping.	How do I know my money goes to the cause and not just to the pockets of the people that run it.	This is a great organization with a very stellar reputation.	There are FAQs on the website that can address all of those concerns, which I certainly can understand.	How about a donation of $25 to start?	How long has Save the Children been helping people all over the world?	It varies for different regions of the world.	Would you be willing to start your donation today, while we're talking?	yes I can donate.	I don't have much. How about .25?	If you think $.25 will get a child fed, we can do that.	However, I think $25 would be more beneficial and it would go to so many good causes.
20180808-034352_717_live	Hello!	How are you doing today?	I'm great!	How are you?	I'm good!	Where are you from?	New York, how about yourself?	PA!	But actually, I'm headed up to Bay Ridge this Saturday!	Nice, I hope it's not too warm this weekend	Me too!	and that the rain holds out.	So, what social issue hits closest to home for you?	I think it's the astronomical costs of healthcare.	Americans pay more for poorer outcomes, compared to peer countries.	I couldn't agree more!	Healthcare costs are crazy over here.	A family pays $500 a month for insurance, but yet blood work is still $200 out of pocket.	There are so many relevent issues going on in the world right now its hard to focus on just one.	What are your thoughts on charities for children?	I think they are important; and there are several focusing on distinct issues.	It's sometimes hard to focus	Have you ever heard of "Save the Children?"	Its a global charity that works to protect children in terms of safety, protect their rights, prevent starvation,get them proper health care and to ensure a proper education for them as well.	Over 1,000 children die every 2 months in Syria from starvation and violence.	Yes, I have	Would you be willing to donate any of your task payment to this charity today?	Any amount over 0$ can be donated, even as little as a few cents and everything helps!	The researchers from this study would do all of the work and ensure the donation gets to the charity.	Sure, I will donate 10 cents	Thank you so much!	That is so kind of you :)	Your donation will help make these children's lives better in some way.	There are so many issues in this world it is hard to do something about or figure out how to help but this is a step in the right direction.	That;s great!	Thank you for telling me about this charity	No problem!	There are so many shady charities out there that I think a lot of people are afraid to donate because they do not know where their money is going, but Save the Children is a great and trustworthy one.	I agree!	Good choice	I hope you have a great day!	Thank you again!	You too!	Have a great week
20180825-090251_7_live	Hi there!	How are you doing today?	great and you are you going to donate	I am not sure what you are talking about.	D you have any more info?	about the children's charity	I have heard about a great charity, and I was going to ask if you are interested.	Would you like to donate some earnings to the Save the Children charity, and if so, how much?	Also, please include the $ sign to avoid confusion.	$5.00 i would donate	Oh, that is really wonderful.	I am so glad.	Have you heard about the flooding in Hawaii?	yes i have	Well, then I am sure you would be glad to know that the charity is all ready to reach out and help the children there.	Were you aware of that?	yes i am	Yes, I am as well.	This really is a great place to donate to.	I am impressed they are so responsive.	I am not sure what I would do if I had a child in need.	Are there any kids in your family at all?	yes i have a child	Yes, I do as well.	I feel really good about helping.	How do you feel about helping?	yes i do	Have you ever donated to any other types of charities?	no i havent	I donate money to places, but I have not donated time.	Have you ever donated time?	no i havent	So, just to recap, I can count on you for a $5 donation today.	Is that right?	yes you can
20180826-182048_519_live	hello	Hi, I currently have a children's charity that I sponsor	ok tell me	We sponsor a child in El Salvador, we have been going it a number of years.	Thats great.	How about you do you have a favorite charity?	I donate money to save the children	what do you know about them are they a good charity?	Yes. Save the children is a great charity.	They are really serious about helping children.	I see - how many years have you been with them	I have been donating money to save the children for 5 years.	I give them 1000 dollars every year.	that is a good approach, i have been doing some research on charities	You can donate any amount to save the children.	Would you like to donate a dollar or more to them?	well that would be a good but I would want to research them first to make sure they are good but maybe you have already done that	I have done my research and I can tell you they are a great organization full of kind / sincere people.	that's great maybe we could both donate to them	Yes that is a great idea.	Would you like the link to their website?	sure can you send it to me	URL	Have a great day.	Thank you for your time.	Thank you for your time.
20180826-173836_197_live	Hi, How are you today?	Hi!	I'm great, how are you?	I'm terrific!	I wanted to talk to you today about a charity I am really involved in	Okay, please tell me about the charity.	This charity is called Save the Children and is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Do you ever donate to charity organizations?	I almost never donate.	Do you?	I definitely do if I believe in the mission of the organization.	This particular organization is helping the future of our world by ensuring that children's rights are protected all over	That sounds really great.	I would be willing to donate to this organization.	That's amazing!	How much would you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount!	I'd like to donate $0.50	That is fantastic, thank you!	The researchers running this task will make sure that the organization receives your donation!	Awesome!	So how exactly does the organization ensure that children's rights are protected?	In the U.S. and around the world, they give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave.	We do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we share.	Wow, that is amazing.	How long have you been involved?	I've been involved with the organization for about a year now and have learned so much about their mission.	They help children here at home and abroad	And what do you do at the organization?	I help promote the organization by speaking to people just like you and helping to generate donations.	Since the organization is not for profit, donations from individuals and organizations help them acheive their mission	Good for you!	I would definitely love to donate and get involved in any way I can.	that is great!	I would like to personally thank you for your donation today!	No problem!	Thank you!	I will donate 50 cents
20180723-112016_503_live	Hello, it's nice to meet you	nice to meet you, do you know any good children's charities	I've always felt confident donating my time and money to a charity called Save the children.	Have you heard of them?	i have not tell me about them	Little typo there, Save the Children.	They work in many countries all over the world and have been proven to spend 86% of their donations actually on children, not administrative fees.	interesting.	how do you help them.	You can choose to donate some or even all of your task payment for this hit directly to Save the Children.	Would you be interested in donating a small portion?	not really.	give me some reasons i should donate	I would be glad to.	Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes.	This charity puts a focus on this under 5, at-risk group.	Just a small donation would go towards vaccinating kids the world over.	is this a religous charity?	They are not affiliated with any religious group.	would donating one penny help	If that's all you feel comfortable donating, the charity would be very appreciative.	are you going to donate too?	Yes, I will be donating half of my payment to Save the Children, as well as having donated in the past.	how much do you think i should donate	I wouldn't force anyone to donate anything, but if you could swing even 50 cents, that would cover 1 vaccine round for 1 child.	i think i will donate one cent.	how do i make the donation?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	ok
20180719-202443_897_live	Hey, how's it going tonight?	Very Well, How about you?	Ok, here too.	I'd like to talk to you about children who are less fortunate.	Do you have a moment?	Yes, please go ahead and tell me	How do you feel about people who just born unlucky?	I feel sorry for them and would like to help them as much as possible	I see I got a really kind person to talk to.	That's great.	Go ahead and tell me how can I help	I'm glad you're so welling to help, but I would feel bad just to get your help without letting you know what the organization is about.	Sure, please tell me about the organization	It's an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	I think I have	They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	that is very good to know	Yes.	Just recently, not sure if you've heard of it, they are working on reuniting children who were separated from their parents at the Mexico-US border.	Thats such a noble thing they are doing	They are very noble.	They're helping kids worldwise but also very close to home.	Would you like to help by donating?	Sure, I would like to help.	How much is the average donation	They get anything from $0.50 to $2 from mturk workers.	I would like to to donate $1.00 as a mturk worker
20180719-211301_463_live	Have you heard of the Save The Children Foundation?	No, I have not.	Can you tell me about it?	They ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	Is it just in one country, or do they work around the world?	Yes.	For example, the child refugees from Syria.	In the first two months of this year, 1000 kids were killed in Syria.	Crazy.	That's so sad.	I wish I could do something to help.	Have you ever donated to a charity?	Yeah, a few local charities.	Like our animal shelter, a low income housing group, foster care organziations, etc	That's very nice of you.	If you'd like to get a better idea of what Save The Children does, and how to possibly donate, you can visit their website at  URL	I'll definitely check them out.	Any organization that helps kids is one worth supporting, either with my own time or with money.	I feel the same way.	How much would you be willing to donate to Save the Children?	I can't afford a lot right now because I have other bills, but I could probably do $5 now with more next month.	That's great!	And generous.	Thank you.	That will make a huge impact.	It feels like so little, but if a lot of people do just a little bit, it really adds up!	It really does.	It's difficult to know nowadays if your money is actually going to the children.	Save the Children seems to be a very trustable fund.	Yeah I agree.	If I donate, even a little, I want it to actually go towards what it should, not just lining the pockets of the CEO.	Indeed.	What would you prefer to see your $5 go to specifically?	Medicine, safety, etc?	I think I would like to see my donation go towards medical care.	At least my initial donation.	I know how hard it can be to be healthy, so I want to help kids get the treatments they need.	That's a great sentiment.	I appreciate the chat and your willingness to donate.	Yeah, you're welcome.	Thank you for introducing me to another great charity that is trying to do good work.	Not only in the USA, but around the world.	Have a great evening!
20180723-042342_809_live	Hello how do you feel about the Save the Children charity?	I think it's a scam	Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I don't believe it.	There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	Plus there are starving children right here in america	This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.	They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That is all your opinion.	You have no facts to back that up.	Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.	This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities	Like I said those are opinions.	There are no facts that prove that to be true.	There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.	I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.	Infomercials don't impress me.	How about the fact that they have been around for over 100 years scams do not stay around that long	Yes they do.	Have you ever heard of evangelism?	Again, you're only giving me an opinion.	I just can't see any good being done.	What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?	Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.	They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.	Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?	Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help	I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.	They also don't disclose their funds	oh see I think I get it now your just selfish and dont care about kids is that about right?	I mean because you personally have never seen it means it does not happen yeah totally.	Stupid	No, I care about  kids in my community, who are in poverty.	I have never seen this organization help them.	I'd rather contribute my donation locally.	Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.	not to mention where are you getting your information?	Saying that they do not disclose funds is an outright lie you can go to  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report and find it all right there.	In just one year directly reached nearly 157,000 children through our U.S. emergency response and preparedness programs.	I mean did you go talk to the families of the kids in your neighboorhood how you know they are not helping there???	How do you know that nothing in your neighborhood is funded by them?	How long are you going to take to respond?	You're making this take far too long!.	How does that equate to reporting financial information?	That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.	There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.	Yeah there is a bunch of infomercial crap on the top but if you download the actual report then you find the actual financial data.	If you would just agree to donate some of your earnings from this hit them it would go much quicker.	You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.	I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	and those local charities they give you their financial info?	There was a shelter in vegas brought in tons of donations cuz they were great yeah right selling any items that were donated and pocketing the cash bigger organizations have more eyes on them	No, but I see the work being done everyday in my community..	Which is why i trust them.	Did you know that most local charities depend on contributions from larger sources and there is a good chance that save the children or another like it helps out

We have to make sure we get a bonus by donating the $2.	It's for Save the Children, and actually my family and I have experience with them.	They're one of the more reputable charities luckily.	But for this to work, I really need you to donate both dollars.	I can not donate until 10 chat turns.	how do you have experience with them?	My family has been involved with charities due to our business.	We make regular donations and Save the Children actually has done the most with what we've given them.	What is your families business and what do you enjoy most of the Save the Children charity?	We own furniture stores on the west coast.	We just love that they're so transparent with their spending and they give us concrete examples of why our past donations have helped them.	could you name a couple of examples please?	Well, the examples they provided were specifically showing us what parts of their charity the money was going towards, and what those parts did.	Essentially a lot of it was relief for the poor, in the form of shelter, clothing and food.	Glad to see it goes to shelter, clothing, and food.	What would benefit me towards donating my $2 to the Save the Children fund?	I can't give you too many details, but trust me, donating the entire 2 would GREATLY benefit you.	Not to mention the satisfaction of helping a charity that actually does good work.	I do like the satisfaction of doing good work for and towards others.	That's fantastic, so do I.	Small amounts actually do go far.	A couple bucks and it's a few meals for someone.	It's mind blowing.	sound good.	You do make a point.	I am interested to help.	Thanks!	Then definitely donate the full two.	You'll be really happy you did, trust me.	I trust you.	I will donate the $2 towards the Save the Children fund.

You can go directly to the Save the Children website for furthur information, and to donate right from there.	What made you interested in this charity and not another one?	An example would be Uniceff	The Save the Children Federation is the most highly rated Charity for helping children and their families recover from disasters and supporting their specific needs.

20180808-063034_444_live	Hi	hello	How's it going	it's going good so far this morning for me.	what about you?	Another day in paradise	haha.	do you live in the states ?	Great state of Texas.	How about you?	chicago.	so what is this about anyway?	it says a child's charity.	I am lost.	I guess I'm supposed to persuade you to donate your bonus to the save the children charity.....	I want you to keep your bonus obviously	it would help to know what childrens charity as well with some information about it.	usually thats how you persuade ppl to donate.	show a pic of a kid etc.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	I do not wish to donate.	I've been given no info about the charity.	They help children in warzones and other poor nations to get food and clothes	oh ok, who is they?	what is the organization ?	Save The Children is the name	no, I do not wish to donate at this time.	there are other charities I'd like to donate to over this one.	I'm sorry.	I don't have a lot to work with either.	Think of the poor kids in Syria who could get so much for the price of a coffee in Chicago.	Do you really need all you have when they have nothing at all?	I don't have much money for myself either which is why I consider this to be my part time job.	I already work full-time to make ends meet.	I'm sorry	But you have a full time job, food, shelter and I'm sure you have family and friends.	These kids families were murdered and they live in rubble that used to be their home, nobody to care for them and they only eat what they can find off the street from the dead.	If they eat at all	that is very sad.	I'd like to look into this charity more before I donate as well.	I'd like to see how the money is dispersed in the company
20180825-071316_761_live	Hi	Hello, do you have any charities in mind that you support?	Yes, I am very fond of Save the Children.	I've never heard of that one.	What is their goal?	They are an international charity that provideds food, basic supplies and reief to children in developing countries	Oh that is interesting.	Have you ever made a donation to them?	Yes, I try to make a donation at least annually	Nice!	How much do they recommend you donate?	I would suggest around $20.	That is enough to signifigantly help a child for several weeks while it is just a week's worth of coffee for you.	I could definitely justify giving $20 to them.	Your donation would be of great help and most would go directly to helping these kids.	Meanwhile, you could feel great about helping those kids who really need your support!	Sounds good, do I just go to the website to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can do that right now.	How much would you likfe to donate?	I will just go ahead and do the $20.	Ok.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Thank you!	I am glad I found a charity I can support.	That great and thanks for your generousity!	No problem.	I always like to help when I can.	You are a good person.	Your donation will be very meaningful to needy children.	Same to you!	The work you do is important.
